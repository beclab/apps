    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared app. Once installed by the Olares Admin, all users in the cluster can use it through reference app.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Ollama is a user-friendly interface for running large language models (LLMs) locally. It is a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to experiment with language models. With Ollama, you can easily download and run LLMs, customize and create your own, and chat with your LLMs using files on your device.

    - Llama 3 8B
    - Llama 3 70B
    - Phi 3 Mini 3.8B
    - Phi 3 Medium 14B
    - Gemma 2 9B
    - Gemma 2 27B
    - Mistral 7B
    - Moondream 2 1.4B
    - Neural Chat 7B
    - Starling 7B
    - Code Llama 7B
    - Llama 2 Uncensored 7B
    - LLaVA 7B
    - Solar 10.7B

  upgradeDescription: |
    Upgrade Ollama version to v0.13.2

    # New models
    - Qwen3-Next: The first installment in the Qwen3-Next series with strong performance in terms of both parameter efficiency and inference speed.

    # What's Changed
    - Flash attention is now enabled by default for vision models such as mistral-3, gemma3, qwen3-vl and more. This improves memory utilization and performance when providing images as input.
    - Fixed GPU detection on multi-GPU CUDA machines
    - Fixed issue where deepseek-v3.1 would always think even with thinking is disabled in Ollama's app
