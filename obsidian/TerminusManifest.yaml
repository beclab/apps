  fullDescription: "Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization\
    \ plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB as\
    \ the server.\nNote: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official \"Obsidian\
    \ Sync\".\n\n# Default credentials\nUsername: admin \nPassword: password\nPlease\
    \ change username and password as soon as possible.\n\n# Features\n- Synchronize\
    \ vaults very efficiently with less traffic.\n\n- Good at conflicted modification.\
    \ \n  * Automatic merging for simple conflicts.\n\n- Using OSS solution for the\
    \ server. \n  * Compatible solutions can be used.\n\n- Supporting End-to-end encryption.\n\
    \n- Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via Customization\
    \ sync(Beta) or Hidden File Sync\n\n- WebClip from obsidian-livesync-webclip\n\
    \nThis plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with\
    \ a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone\
    \ who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.\n\
    \n# Important\n- Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your\
    \ vault up.\n- Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution\
    \ at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).\n- This is a synchronization\
    \ plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.\n\n\n# Sync Setup\
    \ Guide\n1. Install Obsidian LiveSync on Terminus and Obsidian Client on you computer\
    \ or cellphone.\n\n2. Install and Enable Sync Plugin on Primary Device\n   * Open\
    \ Obsidian Client, in Vault-> Settings-> Community Plugins-> Turn on Community\
    \ Plugins-> Browse, install \"Self-hosted LiveSync\".\n   * Enable this plugin\
    \ at Settings-> Community Plugins\n\n3. Setup Remote Database.\n   * Login to\
    \ Obsidian LiveSync with default credentials, and get the app url (e.g. https://8591294e.YOUR_TERMINUS_NAME.snowinning.com)\
    \ and configure information.\n   * Set the configurations at Self-hosted LiveSync->\
    \ Remote Database configuration.\n   * The database name must consist of lowercase\
    \ alphabetic characters.\n\n4. Setup the Subsequent Device\n   * Install and enable\
    \ \"Self-hosted LiveSync\" in the same way as on the primary device.\n   * In\
    \ Self-hosted LiveSync->Setup wizard, use Open setup URI. Paste the setup URI\
    \ from Primary Device (you can get it by clicking the 'Copy setup URI' button\
    \ on the same page at primary device)\n   * If you enable 'End to End Encryption',\
    \ use Passphrase instead of URI\n   * Choose 'Set it up as secondary or subsequent\
    \ device'\n\n5. Start Sync \n   * Open realtime live sync on both device at Setting->\
    \ Community Plugin-> Self-hosted LiveSync->Sync Setting-> LiveSync\n   * Enjoy\
    \ LiveSync!\n"
  upgradeDescription: "Fixed:\n- Fixed the issue that binary files were sometimes\
    \ corrupted.\n- Fixed customisation sync data could be corrupted.\n  Please let\
    \ me know if you find anything strange about these two fixes. It is getting a\
    \ bit complicated in this area.\n\nImproved:\n- Now the remote database costs\
    \ lower memory. (#382)\n- This release requires a brief wait on the first synchronisation,\
    \ to track the latest changeset again.\n- Description added for the Device name.\
    \ (#391)\n\nRefactored:\n- Many type-errors have been resolved.\n- Obsolete file\
    \ has been deleted.\n\nCheck the full release note at: https://github.com/vrtmrz/obsidian-livesync/releases/tag/0.22.16\n"
