  fullDescription: |
    Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB as the server.
    Note: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official "Obsidian Sync".

    # Features
    - Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.

    - Good at conflicted modification. 
      * Automatic merging for simple conflicts.

    - Using OSS solution for the server. 
      * Compatible solutions can be used.

    - Supporting End-to-end encryption.

    - Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via Customization sync(Beta) or Hidden File Sync

    - WebClip from obsidian-livesync-webclip

    This plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.

    # Important
    - Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your vault up.
    - Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
    - This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.

  upgradeDescription: |
    Fixed:
    - Fixed the issue that binary files were sometimes corrupted.
    - Fixed customisation sync data could be corrupted.
      Please let me know if you find anything strange about these two fixes. It is getting a bit complicated in this area.

    Improved:
    - Now the remote database costs lower memory. (#382)
    - This release requires a brief wait on the first synchronisation, to track the latest changeset again.
    - Description added for the Device name. (#391)

    Refactored:
    - Many type-errors have been resolved.
    - Obsolete file has been deleted.
