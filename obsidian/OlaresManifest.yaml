    # Overview
    Self-hosted LiveSync is a community-implemented synchronization plugin, available on every obsidian-compatible platform and using CouchDB as the server.
    Note: This plugin cannot synchronise with the official "Obsidian Sync".

    # Features
    - Synchronize vaults very efficiently with less traffic.

    - Good at conflicted modification.
      * Automatic merging for simple conflicts.

    - Using OSS solution for the server.
      * Compatible solutions can be used.

    - Supporting End-to-end encryption.

    - Synchronisation of settings, snippets, themes, and plug-ins, via Customization sync(Beta) or Hidden File Sync

    - WebClip from obsidian-livesync-webclip

    This plug-in might be useful for researchers, engineers, and developers with a need to keep their notes fully self-hosted for security reasons. Or just anyone who would like the peace of mind of knowing that their notes are fully private.

    # Important
    - Before installing or upgrading this plug-in, please back your vault up.
    - Do not enable this plugin with another synchronization solution at the same time (including iCloud and Obsidian Sync).
    - This is a synchronization plugin. Not a backup solution. Do not rely on this for backup.
