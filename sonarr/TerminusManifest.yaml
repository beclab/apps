  fullDescription: 'Sonarr is a PVR for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can monitor
    multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and will grab, sort
    and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically upgrade the quality
    of files already downloaded when a better quality format becomes available.


    Features

    - Calendar: See all your upcoming episodes in one convenient location.


    - Manual Search: Find all the releases, choose the one you want and send it right
    to your download client.


    - Automatic Failed Download Handling: Sonarr makes failed downloads a thing of
    the past. Password protected releases, missing repair blocks or virtually any
    other reason? no worries. Sonarr will automatically block the release and try
    another one until it finds one that works.
