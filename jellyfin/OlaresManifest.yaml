  fullDescription: |
    Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media. It is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.

    Jellyfin enables you to collect, manage, and stream your media. Run the Jellyfin server on your system and gain access to the leading free-software entertainment system, bells and whistles included.

    With Jellyfin, you can
    * Enjoy your entire movie collection, easy to browse and with beautiful artwork.
    * Watch your favorite shows, automatically sorted by season and ready to binge.
    * Listen to music, your artists and your playlists, at home or on the go.
    * Watch TV and set automatic recordings to expand your library.
    * Read your books, comics, and magazines.
    * Organize your photos and share memories with your friends and family.
    * Sharing a movie night remotely. It has never been so easy.

    Why Jellyfin
    # Privacy Focused
    Jellyfin has no tracking, phone-home, or central servers collecting your data. We believe in keeping our software open and transparent. We're also not in the media business, so the only media you see is your own.

    # Free Software
    Jellyfin is Free Software, licensed under the GNU GPL. You can use it, study it, modify it, build it, and distribute it for free, as long as your changes are licensed the same way.

    # No Fees
    The Jellyfin server and official clients are free to download, now and always. There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use Jellyfin, either for yourself, for your friends, or for your company. All our incidental costs are paid through donations from users like you.

    # Community Built
    The project relies entirely on contributions from volunteers. Want to help out? There's lots of ways to do so, and you don't even have to code!
