  fullDescription: |
    listmonk is a standalone, self-hosted, newsletter and mailing list manager. It is fast, feature-rich, and packed into a single binary. It uses a PostgreSQL (⩾ 12) database as its data store.

    Features
    One-way mailing lists
    - Manage millions of subscribers across many single and double opt-in one-way mailing lists with custom JSON attributes for each subscriber. Query and segment subscribers with SQL expressions.
    - Use the fast bulk importer (~10k records per second) or use HTTP/JSON APIs or interact with the simple table schema to integrate external CRMs and subscriber databases.

    Transactional mails
    - Simple API to send arbitrary transactional messages to subscribers using pre-defined templates. Send messages as e-mail, SMS, Whatsapp messages or any medium via Messenger interfaces.

    Analytics
    - Simple analytics and visualizations. Connect external visualization programs to the database easily with the simple table structure.

    Templating
    - Create powerful, dynamic e-mail templates with the Go templating language. Use template expressions, logic, and 100+ functions in subject lines and content. Write HTML e-mails in a WYSIWYG editor, Markdown, raw syntax-highlighted HTML, or just plain text.

    Performance
    - Multi-threaded, high-throughput, multi-SMTP e-mail queues. Throughput and sliding window rate limiting for fine grained control. Single binary application with nominal CPU and memory footprint that runs everywhere. The only dependency is a Postgres (⩾ 12) database.

    Media
    - Use the media manager to upload images for e-mail campaigns on the server's filesystem, Amazon S3, or any S3 compatible (Minio) backend.

    Extensible
    - More than just e-mail campaigns. Connect HTTP webhooks to send SMS, Whatsapp, FCM notifications, or any type of messages.

    Privacy
    - Allow subscribers to permanently blocklist themselves, export all their data, and to wipe all their data in a single click.
