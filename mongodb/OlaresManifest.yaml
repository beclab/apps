    - SERVER-98720 - Added redaction of the BSON command for "Plan executor error" warning logs to prevent the entire command text (possibly including PII) to end up in the logs
    - SERVER-100594 - Limited JSON recursion to 200 levels
    - SERVER-101298 - Removed acquisition of database and collection locks when acquiring the global lock in compaction
