    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is the corresponding client app of "Stable Fast 3d For Cluster". It requires "Stable Fast 3d For Cluster" to be installed on your Olares cluster first.
    
    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Stable Fast 3D is a state-of-the-art open-source model for fast feedforward 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image.
    Stable Fast 3D is based on TripoSR but introduces several new key techniques. For one, we explicitly optimize our model to produce good meshes without artifacts alongside textures with UV unwrapping. We also delight the color and predict material parameters so the assets can be easily integrated into a game. We achieve all of this while still maintaining the fast inference speeds of TripoSR.
