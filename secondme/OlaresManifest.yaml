  fullDescription: |    
    Second Me: The first open-source AI identity system that delivers 100% private, deeply personalized AI agents built specifically to represent your authentic self. It doesn't just learn your preferences—it comprehends your unique thinking patterns, represents you across different contexts, forms collaborative networks with other Second Mes, and creates new value in the emerging Agent economy.

    Our mission is clear: safeguarding your distinct identity—your, "Me"—while giving you a powerful new way to exist and express yourself in the AI age.

    Key Features:
    Train Your AI Self with AI-Native Memory
    - Start training your Second Me today with your own memories! Using Hierarchical Memory Modeling (HMM) and the Me-Alignment Algorithm, your AI self captures your identity, understands your context, and reflects you authentically.

    Scale Your Intelligence on the Second Me Network
    - Launch your AI self from your laptop onto our decentralized network—anyone or any app can connect with your permission, sharing your context as your digital identity.

    Build Tomorrow’s Apps with Second Me
    - Roleplay: Your AI self switches personas to represent you in different scenarios.  
    - AI Space: Collaborate with other Second Mes to spark ideas or solve problems.

    100% Privacy and Control
    - Unlike traditional centralized AI systems, Second Me ensures that your information and intelligence remain local and completely private.
