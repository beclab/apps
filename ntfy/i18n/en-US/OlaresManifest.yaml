  fullDescription: |
    ntfy is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, and/or using a REST API.

    Send push notifications from your app or script
    - Publishing messages can be done via PUT or POST. Topics are created on the fly by subscribing or publishing to them. If you use ntfy without sign-up, the topic is essentially a password, so pick something that's not easily guessable.

    Receive notifications on your phone
    - Subscribe to a topic and receive notifications, with different priorities, attachments, action buttons, tags & emojis, and even for automation.

    Get notified on your computer
    - You can use the web app to subscribe to topics as well. If you do, notifications will pop up as desktop notifications. Simply type in the topic name and click the Subscribe button. The browser will keep a connection open and listen for incoming notifications.

    Integrate with your favorite tools
    - Publishing messages is just a HTTP request, so pretty much everything under the sun can integrate with ntfy. Hundreds of integrations, projects or scripts already support ntfy.
