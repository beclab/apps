## Description

This repo contains GGUF format model files for [Mistral AI_'s Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2).

These files were quantised using hardware kindly provided by [Massed Compute](https://massedcompute.com/).


## Prompt template: Mistral

```
<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]
```

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Thanks, and how to contribute

Thanks to the [chirper.ai](https://chirper.ai) team!

Thanks to Clay from [gpus.llm-utils.org](llm-utils)!

I've had a lot of people ask if they can contribute. I enjoy providing models and helping people, and would love to be able to spend even more time doing it, as well as expanding into new projects like fine tuning/training.

If you're able and willing to contribute it will be most gratefully received and will help me to keep providing more models, and to start work on new AI projects.

Donaters will get priority support on any and all AI/LLM/model questions and requests, access to a private Discord room, plus other benefits.

# Original model card: Mistral AI_'s Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2

The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is an improved instruct fine-tuned version of [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1).

For full details of this model please read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825) and [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/).

## Instruction format

In order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should be surrounded by `[INST]` and `[/INST]` tokens. The very first instruction should begin with a begin of sentence id. The next instructions should not. The assistant generation will be ended by the end-of-sentence token id.

E.g.
```
text = "<s>[INST] What is your favourite condiment? [/INST]"
"Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!</s> "
"[INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST]"
```

This format is available as a [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating) via the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"}
]

encodeds = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")

model_inputs = encodeds.to(device)
model.to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=1000, do_sample=True)
decoded = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)
print(decoded[0])
```

## Model Architecture
This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices:
- Grouped-Query Attention
- Sliding-Window Attention
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

## Troubleshooting
- If you see the following error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/transformers/models/auto/auto_factory.py", line 482, in from_pretrained
config, kwargs = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 1022, in from_pretrained
config_class = CONFIG_MAPPING[config_dict["model_type"]]
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 723, in getitem
raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'mistral'
```

Installing transformers from source should solve the issue
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

This should not be required after transformers-v4.33.4.

## Limitations

The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance.
It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to
make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
