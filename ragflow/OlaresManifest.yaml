    What is RAGFlow?
    RAGFlow is an open-source RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine based on deep document understanding. It offers a streamlined RAG workflow for businesses of any scale, combining LLM (Large Language Models) to provide truthful question-answering capabilities, backed by well-founded citations from various complex formatted data.

    Key Features
    "Quality in, quality out"
    - Deep document understanding-based knowledge extraction from unstructured data with complicated formats.
    - Finds "needle in a data haystack" of literally unlimited tokens.
    
    Template-based chunking
    - Intelligent and explainable.
    - Plenty of template options to choose from.
    
    Grounded citations with reduced hallucinations
    - Visualization of text chunking to allow human intervention.
    - Quick view of the key references and traceable citations to support grounded answers.
    
    Compatibility with heterogeneous data sources
    - Supports Word, slides, excel, txt, images, scanned copies, structured data, web pages, and more.
    
    Automated and effortless RAG workflow
    - Streamlined RAG orchestration catered to both personal and large businesses.
    - Configurable LLMs as well as embedding models.
    - Multiple recall paired with fused re-ranking.
    - Intuitive APIs for seamless integration with business.
  upgradeDescription: |
    Upgrade app version to v0.18.0
    
    New features
    - MCP server: enables access to RAGFlow's knowledge bases via MCP.
    - DeepDoc supports adopting VLM model as a processing pipeline during document layout recognition, enabling in-depth analysis of images in PDFs.
    - Agent version control: all updates are continuously logged and can be rolled back to a previous version via export.
    - Team collaboration: Agents can be shared with team members.
    - OpenAI-compatible APIs: Agents can be called via OpenAI-compatible APIs.
    - User registration control: administrators can enable or disable user registration through an environment variable.
    
    Improvements
    - Enhanced answer referencing: Citation accuracy in generated responses is improved.
    - Enhanced question-answering experience: users can now manually stop streaming output during a conversation.
    
    Compatibility changes
    - From this release on wards, built-in re-rank models have been removed because they have minimal impact on retrieval rates but significantly increase retrieval time.
