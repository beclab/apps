    - Intelligent and explainable.
    - Plenty of template options to choose from.
    
    Grounded citations with reduced hallucinations
    - Visualization of text chunking to allow human intervention.
    - Quick view of the key references and traceable citations to support grounded answers.
    
    Compatibility with heterogeneous data sources

    Automated and effortless RAG workflow
    - Streamlined RAG orchestration catered to both personal and large businesses.
