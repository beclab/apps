    fullDescription: |
      Frigate is a complete and local NVR designed for Home Assistant with AI object detection. Uses OpenCV and Tensorflow to perform realtime object detection locally for IP cameras.

      Main Features
      - Tight integration with Home Assistant via a custom component
      - Designed to minimize resource use and maximize performance by only looking for objects when and where it is necessary
      - Leverages multiprocessing heavily with an emphasis on realtime over processing every frame
      - Uses a very low overhead motion detection to determine where to run object detection
      - Object detection with TensorFlow runs in separate processes for maximum FPS
      - Communicates over MQTT for easy integration into other systems
      - Records video with retention settings based on detected objects
      - 24/7 recording
      - Re-streaming via RTSP to reduce the number of connections to your camera
      - WebRTC & MSE support for low-latency live view
