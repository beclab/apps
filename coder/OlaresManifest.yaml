  fullDescription: |
    Coder is a self-hosted, open source, cloud development environment that works with any cloud, IDE, OS, Git provider, and IDP.
    
    Coder enables organizations to set up development environments in their public or private cloud infrastructure. Cloud development environments are defined with Terraform, connected through a secure high-speed WireguardÂ® tunnel, and automatically shut down when not used to save on costs. Coder gives engineering teams the flexibility to use the cloud for workloads most beneficial to them.

    Features

    - EC2 VMs, Kubernetes Pods, Docker Containers, etc.
    
    Automatically shutdown idle resources to save on costs
