    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is the corresponding client app of "ComfyUI For Cluster". It requires "Dify For Cluster" to be installed on your Terminus cluster first.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

    This ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using
    a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.

    Features
    - Nodes/graph/flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion
    workflows without needing to code anything.
    - Fully supports SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, Stable Video Diffusion and Stable Cascade
    - Asynchronous Queue system
    - Many optimizations: Only re-executes the parts of the workflow that changes
    between executions.
    - Command line option: --lowvram to make it work on GPUs with less than 3GB vram
    (enabled automatically on GPUs with low vram)
    - Works even if you don''t have a GPU with: --cpu (slow)
    - Can load ckpt, safetensors and diffusers models/checkpoints. Standalone VAEs
    and CLIP models.
    - Embeddings/Textual inversion
    - Loras (regular, locon and loha)
    - Hypernetworks
    - Loading full workflows (with seeds) from generated PNG files.
    - Saving/Loading workflows as Json files.
    - Nodes interface can be used to create complex workflows like one for Hires fix
    or much more advanced ones.
    - Area Composition
    - Inpainting with both regular and inpainting models.
    - ControlNet and T2I-Adapter
    - Upscale Models (ESRGAN, ESRGAN variants, SwinIR, Swin2SR, etc...)
    - unCLIP Models
    - GLIGEN
    - Model Merging
    - LCM models and Loras
    - SDXL Turbo
    - Latent previews with TAESD
    - Starts up very fast.
    - Works fully offline: will never download anything.
    - Config file to set the search paths for models.
