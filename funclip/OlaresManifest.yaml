  fullDescription: |
    FunClip is a fully open-source, locally deployed automated video clipping tool. It leverages Alibaba TONGYI speech lab's open-source FunASR Paraformer series models to perform speech recognition on videos. Then, users can freely choose text segments or speakers from the recognition results and click the clip button to obtain the video clip corresponding to the selected segments.

    Highlights
    - Try AI clipping using LLM in FunClip now.
    
    - FunClip integrates Alibaba's open-source industrial-grade model Paraformer-Large, which is one of the best-performing open-source Chinese ASR models available, with over 13 million downloads on Modelscope. It can also accurately predict timestamps in an integrated manner.
    
    - FunClip incorporates the hotword customization feature of SeACo-Paraformer, allowing users to specify certain entity words, names, etc., as hotwords during the ASR process to enhance recognition results.
    
    - FunClip integrates the CAM++ speaker recognition model, enabling users to use the auto-recognized speaker ID as the target for trimming, to clip segments from a specific speaker.
    
    - The functionalities are realized through Gradio interaction, offering simple installation and ease of use. It can also be deployed on a server and accessed via a browser.
    
    - FunClip supports multi-segment free clipping and automatically returns full video SRT subtitles and target segment SRT subtitles, offering a simple and convenient user experience.
