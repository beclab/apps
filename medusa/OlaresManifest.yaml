    # Fixes regression with link migrations

    This release fixes a regression in type generation during builds that could cause build failures under certain conditions. In PR #14493, we updated the build process to generate Medusa’s autogenerated types at build time, ensuring they are available both during development and in production.

    This change introduced an unintended issue in the build process. Generating types during the build requires bootstrapping the application. During bootstrap, several core internal loaders are executed, including those responsible for establishing database connections. These loaders depend on specific environment variables, and when those variables are not present, the build fails.

    This release changes the types generation to rely on a “lightweight” bootstrap mode , which allows the application to start without executing these core internal loaders, avoiding the dependency on environment variables during the build phase.
