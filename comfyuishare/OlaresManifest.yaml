    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared version of ComfyUI. Only one service will be installed across the entire Olares system. However, every user still needs to install an desktop entry to access and use the service installed by the Olares Admin.

    After installation, everyone on this Olares cluster can use the same application. This shared setup makes it easier for users to share information with each other, while reducing maintenance work and using fewer resources.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

    This ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using
    a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.

    Features
    - Nodes/graph/flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion workflows without needing to code anything.
    - Image Models
      * SD1.x, SD2.x,
      * SDXL, SDXL Turbo
      * Stable Cascade
      * SD3 and SD3.5
      * Pixart Alpha and Sigma
      * AuraFlow
      * HunyuanDiT
      * Flux
      * Lumina Image 2.0
      * HiDream
      * Cosmos Predict2
      * Qwen Image
    - Image Editing Models
      * Omnigen 2
      * Flux Kontext
      * HiDream E1.1
      * Qwen Image Edit
    - Video Models
      * Stable Video Diffusion
      * Mochi
      * LTX-Video
      * Hunyuan Video
      * Nvidia Cosmos and Cosmos Predict2
      * Wan 2.1
      * Wan 2.2
    - Audio Models
      * Stable Audio
      * ACE Step
    - 3D Models
      * Hunyuan3D 2.0
    - Asynchronous Queue system
    - Many optimizations: Only re-executes the parts of the workflow that changes between executions.
    - Smart memory management: can automatically run models on GPUs with as low as 1GB vram.
    - Works even if you don't have a GPU with: --cpu (slow)
    - Can load ckpt, safetensors and diffusers models/checkpoints. Standalone VAEs and CLIP models.
    - Embeddings/Textual inversion
    - Loras (regular, locon and loha)
    - Hypernetworks
    - Loading full workflows (with seeds) from generated PNG, WebP and FLAC files.
    - Saving/Loading workflows as Json files.
    - Nodes interface can be used to create complex workflows like one for Hires fix or much more advanced ones.
    - Area Composition
    - Inpainting with both regular and inpainting models.
    - ControlNet and T2I-Adapter
    - Upscale Models (ESRGAN, ESRGAN variants, SwinIR, Swin2SR, etc...)
    - unCLIP Models
    - GLIGEN
    - Model Merging
    - LCM models and Loras
    - Latent previews with TAESD
    - Starts up very fast.
    - Works fully offline: core will never download anything unless you want to.
    - Optional API nodes to use paid models from external providers through the online Comfy API.
    - Config file to set the search paths for models.
