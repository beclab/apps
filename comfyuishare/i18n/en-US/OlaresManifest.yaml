    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared version of ComfyUI. Only one service will be installed across the entire Olares system. However, every user still needs to install an desktop entry to access and use the service installed by the Olares Admin.

    After installation, everyone on this Olares cluster can use the same application. This shared setup makes it easier for users to share information with each other, while reducing maintenance work and using fewer resources.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

    This ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using
    a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.

    Features
    - Nodes/graph/flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion
    workflows without needing to code anything.
    - Fully supports SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, Stable Video Diffusion and Stable Cascade
    - Asynchronous Queue system
    - Many optimizations: Only re-executes the parts of the workflow that changes
    between executions.
    - Command line option: --lowvram to make it work on GPUs with less than 3GB vram
    (enabled automatically on GPUs with low vram)
    - Works even if you don''t have a GPU with: --cpu (slow)
    - Can load ckpt, safetensors and diffusers models/checkpoints. Standalone VAEs
    and CLIP models.
    - Embeddings/Textual inversion
    - Loras (regular, locon and loha)
    - Hypernetworks
    - Loading full workflows (with seeds) from generated PNG files.
    - Saving/Loading workflows as Json files.
    - Nodes interface can be used to create complex workflows like one for Hires fix
    or much more advanced ones.
    - Area Composition
    - Inpainting with both regular and inpainting models.
    - ControlNet and T2I-Adapter
    - Upscale Models (ESRGAN, ESRGAN variants, SwinIR, Swin2SR, etc...)
    - unCLIP Models
    - GLIGEN
    - Model Merging
    - LCM models and Loras
    - SDXL Turbo
    - Latent previews with TAESD
    - Starts up very fast.
    - Works fully offline: will never download anything.
    - Config file to set the search paths for models.
