    ## OVERVIEW ##
    The Hunyuan-MT comprises a translation model, Hunyuan-MT-7B, and an ensemble model, Hunyuan-MT-Chimera. The translation model is used to translate source text into the target language, while the ensemble model integrates multiple translation outputs to produce a higher-quality result. It primarily supports mutual translation among 33 languages, including five ethnic minority languages in China.


    Key Features and Advantages
    - In the WMT25 competition, the model achieved first place in 30 out of the 31 language categories it participated in.
    - Hunyuan-MT-7B achieves industry-leading performance among models of comparable scale
    - Hunyuan-MT-Chimera-7B is the industry’s first open-source translation ensemble model, elevating translation quality to a new level
    - A comprehensive training framework for translation models has been proposed, spanning from pretrain → cross-lingual pretraining (CPT) → supervised fine-tuning (SFT) → translation enhancement → ensemble refinement, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results for models of similar size
