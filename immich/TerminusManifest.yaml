  upgradeDescription: |
    Welcome to release v1.108.0 of Immich. This release focuses on bug fixes and improvements across the app. We added a fun section of things we learned when working on Immich. You can take a look here at the Cursed Knowledge page. Some of the highlights in this release include:
