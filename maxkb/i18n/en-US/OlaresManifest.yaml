    # Overview
    MaxKB = Max Knowledge Base, it is a chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). MaxKB is widely applied in scenarios such as intelligent customer service, corporate internal knowledge bases, academic research, and education.

    Ready-to-Use: 
    Supports direct uploading of documents / automatic crawling of online documents, with features for automatic text splitting, vectorization, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). This effectively reduces hallucinations in large models, providing a superior smart Q&A interaction experience.
    
    Flexible Orchestration: 
    Equipped with a powerful workflow engine and function library, enabling the orchestration of AI processes to meet the needs of complex business scenarios.

    Seamless Integration: 
    Facilitates zero-coding rapid integration into third-party business systems, quickly equipping existing systems with intelligent Q&A capabilities to enhance user satisfaction.

    Model-Agnostic: 
    Supports various large models, including private models (such as DeepSeek, Llama, Qwen, etc.) and public models (like OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
