    Ghost is a powerful app for professional publishers to create, share, and grow a business around their content. It comes with modern tools to build a website, publish content, send newsletters & offer paid subscriptions to members.

    # EASY SITE DESIGN
    Complete control over your website and branding.
    - Launch a custom website and tweak the design settings to perfectly match your brand and style.
    - Go even further with hundreds of custom themes in our marketplace, or build your own completely custom design from scratch.
    - Your unique brand sits front and center, while Ghost runs things in the background.

    # ADVANCED CREATOR TOOLS
    Publish by web & email newsletter.
    - An editor built from the ground-up for professionals. Calm by design, with advanced workflows by default. 
    - No more suffering through clumsy toolbars or drag & oops.
    - Rich media & dynamic cards.

    # GROW YOUR AUDIENCE
    Transform those clicks into contacts.
    - Ghost makes it easy, with native signup forms that turn anonymous views into logged-in members.
    - Allow people to sign up for free, or purchase a paid subscription to support your work across monthly and yearly premium tiers.

    # RUN YOUR BUSINESS
    Manage your memberships.
    - See who's signing up, who's paying, and what they're reading, so you can get a better understanding of your core audience.
