  fullDescription: |
    Studio is a comprehensive development tool to streamline the building, testing, and deployment of applications on Olares.

    Why is Studio necessary for developers?
    Olares has many cloud-based features that are difficult to simulate in a standalone development environment. Furthermore, the unique sandbox system of Olares requires a real system environment for end-to-end testing. To simplify app simulation for developers and minimize system integration efforts during development, we provide the Studio. Studio is a quick, automatic toolset for creating app sandboxes.

    Features:
    Sandboxed Application Porting & Debugging
    - Automated Configuration Generation: During app building, Studio automatically generates Olares Application Configuration files, allowing flexible modifications for porting existing applications.
    - Continuous Testing & Optimization: Modify configurations iteratively, test installations in real-time, and resolve issues promptly before final deployment.
    - Simple to publish: After successful testing, download the Application Chart and submit it directly to the Olares Market Repository for publication.

    Native Application Development
    - Studio provides an online development container where coders can work in a real environment, utilize other system interfaces, database clusters, and more.
