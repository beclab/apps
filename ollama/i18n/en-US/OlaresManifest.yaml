    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared app. Once installed by the Olares Admin, all users in the cluster can use it through reference app.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Ollama is a user-friendly interface for running large language models (LLMs) locally. It is a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to experiment with language models. With Ollama, you can easily download and run LLMs, customize and create your own, and chat with your LLMs using files on your device.

    Ollama supports a wide range of models, including:
    - Llama 3	8B
    - Llama 3	70B
    - Phi 3 Mini	3.8B
    - Phi 3 Medium	14B
    - Gemma 2	9B
    - Gemma 2	27B
    - Mistral	7B
    - Moondream 2	1.4B
    - Neural Chat	7B
    - Starling	7B
    - Code Llama	7B
    - Llama 2 Uncensored	7B
    - LLaVA	7B
    - Solar	10.7B
