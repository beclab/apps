    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Ollama is a user-friendly interface for running large language models (LLMs) locally. It is a valuable tool for researchers, developers, and anyone who wants to experiment with language models. With Ollama, you can easily download and run LLMs, customize and create your own, and chat with your LLMs using files on your device.

    Ollama supports a wide range of models, including:
    - Llama 3	8B
    - Llama 3	70B
    - Phi 3 Mini	3.8B
    - Phi 3 Medium	14B
    - Gemma 2	9B
    - Gemma 2	27B
    - Mistral	7B
    - Moondream 2	1.4B
    - Neural Chat	7B
    - Starling	7B
    - Code Llama	7B
    - Llama 2 Uncensored	7B
    - LLaVA	7B
    - Solar	10.7B

    Upgrade Ollama version to v0.9.4-rc6

    # What's Changed
    - Fixed issue where tool calls would not be parsed when they were called with an empty set of arguments
    - Fixed issue when quantizing models with the Gemma 3n architecture
    - Fixed issue where errors would not be properly reported on Apple Silicon Macs
    - Ollama will now limit context length to what the model was trained against to avoid strange overflow behavior
