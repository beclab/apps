  fullDescription: |
    Focalboard is an open source, multilingual, self-hosted project management tool that's an alternative to Trello, Notion, and Asana.

    Accelerate productivity
    Centralize, plan, and track all your work in one place. Focalboard helps your organization maintain a single source of truth, so your teams stay aligned to complete tasks, reach milestones, and achieve their goals.

    Organize and visualize work, your way
    Work in the way that suits you best. Manage all your tasks on a Kanban, table, gallery, and calendar view. Focus on the highest priority items with board filters, and save an unlimited number of filtered views for quick access later.

    Align your teams with real-time collaboration
    Keep everyone in sync with card comments, mention teammates to get their attention, and set board permissions to share your board with the entire team or specific individuals.
