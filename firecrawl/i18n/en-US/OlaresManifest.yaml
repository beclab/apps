    # Overview
    Firecrawl is an API service that takes a URL, crawls it, and converts it into clean markdown or structured data. We crawl all accessible subpages and give you clean data for each. No sitemap required.

    # Features
    - Scrape: scrapes a URL and get its content in LLM-ready format (markdown, structured data via LLM Extract, screenshot, html)
    - Crawl: scrapes all the URLs of a web page and return content in LLM-ready format
    - Map: input a website and get all the website urls - extremely fast
    - Extract: get structured data from single page, multiple pages or entire websites with AI.
    
    # Powerful Capabilities
    - LLM-ready formats: markdown, structured data, screenshot, HTML, links, metadata
    - The hard stuff: proxies, anti-bot mechanisms, dynamic content (js-rendered), output parsing, orchestration
    - Customizability: exclude tags, crawl behind auth walls with custom headers, max crawl depth, etc...
    - Media parsing: pdfs, docx, images
    - Reliability first: designed to get the data you need - no matter how hard it is
    - Actions: click, scroll, input, wait and more before extracting data
    - Batching (New): scrape thousands of URLs at the same time with a new async endpoint.
