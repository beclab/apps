  description: Unified framework for robot learning built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim
spec:
  fullDescription: |
    Isaac Lab is a GPU-accelerated, open-source framework designed to unify and simplify robotics research workflows, such as reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and motion planning. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, it combines fast and accurate physics and sensor simulation, making it an ideal choice for sim-to-real transfer in robotics.
    
    Isaac Lab provides developers with a range of essential features for accurate sensor simulation, such as RTX-based cameras, LIDAR, or contact sensors. The framework's GPU acceleration enables users to run complex simulations and computations faster, which is key for iterative processes like reinforcement learning and data-intensive tasks. Moreover, Isaac Lab can run locally or be distributed across the cloud, offering flexibility for large-scale deployments.

    Key Features
    Isaac Lab offers a comprehensive set of tools and environments designed to facilitate robot learning:

    Robots: A diverse collection of robots, from manipulators, quadrupeds, to humanoids, with more than 16 commonly available models.
    Environments: Ready-to-train implementations of more than 30 environments, which can be trained with popular reinforcement learning frameworks such as RSL RL, SKRL, RL Games, or Stable Baselines. We also support multi-agent reinforcement learning.
    Physics: Rigid bodies, articulated systems, deformable objects
    Sensors: RGB/depth/segmentation cameras, camera annotations, IMU, contact sensors, ray casters.
