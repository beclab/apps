    Model Visual Recognition

    LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

    Text to Image Generation
    With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent.
