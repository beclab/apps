  fullDescription: |
    Lobe Chat is An open-source, modern-design ChatGPT/LLMs UI/Framework. Supports speech-synthesis, multi-modal, and extensible (function call) plugin system.

    # Features
    File Upload/Knowledge Base
    LobeChat supports file upload and knowledge base functionality. You can upload various types of files including documents, images, audio, and video, as well as create knowledge bases, making it convenient for users to manage and search for files. Additionally, you can utilize files and knowledge base features during conversations, enabling a richer dialogue experience.

    Multi-Model Service Provider Support
    We have implemented support for the following model service providers:
    - OpenAI
    - Ollama
    - Anthropic
    - Bedrock
    - Google
    - DeepSeek
    - HuggingFace
    - OpenRouter
    - Cloudflare Workers AI
    - GitHub

    Local Large Language Model (LLM) Support
    To meet the specific needs of users, LobeChat also supports the use of local models based on Ollama, allowing users to flexibly use their own or third-party models.

    Model Visual Recognition
    LobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest gpt-4-vision model with visual recognition capabilities, a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box, and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this, creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

    TTS & STT Voice Conversation
    LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

    Text to Image Generation
    With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent.

    Plugin System (Function Calling)
    The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeChat assistant.

    Agent Market (GPTs)
    In LobeChat Agent Marketplace, creators can discover a vibrant and innovative community that brings together a multitude of well-designed agents, which not only play an important role in work scenarios but also offer great convenience in learning processes.

    Support Multi-User Management
    LobeChat supports multi-user management and provides two main user authentication and management solutions to meet different needs
    - next-auth: LobeChat integrates next-auth, a flexible and powerful identity verification library that supports multiple authentication methods
    - Clerk: For users who need more advanced user management features, LobeChat also supports Clerk, a modern user management platform. 

    Progressive Web App (PWA) and Mobile Device Adaptation
    Through PWA, LobeChat can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining its lightweight and high-performance characteristics

    Custom Themes
    As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeChat places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences, hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime. Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences.
