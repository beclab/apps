    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is the corresponding client app of "Dify For Cluster". It requires "Dify For Cluster" to be installed on your Olares cluster first.

    This app acts as a bridge, establishing a connection between Dify and other services such as Files and Agent.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Dify is an open-source LLM app development platform. Its intuitive interface combines AI workflow, RAG pipeline, agent capabilities, model management, observability features and more, letting you quickly go from prototype to production. Here's a list of the core features:

    1. Workflow: Build and test powerful AI workflows on a visual canvas, leveraging all the following features and beyond.

    2. Comprehensive model support: Seamless integration with hundreds of proprietary / open-source LLMs from dozens of inference providers and self-hosted solutions, covering GPT, Mistral, Llama3, and any OpenAI API-compatible models. A full list of supported model providers can be found here.

    3. Prompt IDE: Intuitive interface for crafting prompts, comparing model performance, and adding additional features such as text-to-speech to a chat-based app.

    4. RAG Pipeline: Extensive RAG capabilities that cover everything from document ingestion to retrieval, with out-of-box support for text extraction from PDFs, PPTs, and other common document formats.

    5. Agent capabilities: You can define agents based on LLM Function Calling or ReAct, and add pre-built or custom tools for the agent. Dify provides 50+ built-in tools for AI agents, such as Google Search, DELL·E, Stable Diffusion and WolframAlpha.

    6. LLMOps: Monitor and analyze application logs and performance over time. You could continuously improve prompts, datasets, and models based on production data and annotations.

    7. Backend-as-a-Service: All of Dify's offerings come with corresponding APIs, so you could effortlessly integrate Dify into your own business logic.

    We’re thrilled to announce the release of v0.14.2, packed with new features and critical enhancements. Here’s everything new in this update:

    New Features
    Workflow Retry Functionality: We've enhanced workflow resilience with a retry feature by @zxhlyh. Your nodes will make repeat attempts if they face execution errors, minimizing disruptions.

    Order Support in Models: Now you can specify the order between text and files when using models like Gemini and Claude, thanks to the work of @laipz8200. This gives you precise control over data flow.

    Azure GPT-4o-2024-11-20 Model: Thanks to @agungbesti, this powerful model is now part of our lineup, offering advanced capabilities for your needs.

    Gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219: Explore this cutting-edge model brought to you by @hjlarry—designed to enhance your application capabilities.

    And many enhancements and bug fixes
