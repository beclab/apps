    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared app. Only one service will be installed across the entire Olares system. However, every user still needs to install an desktop entry to access and use the service installed by the Olares Admin.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge is a platform on top of the original Stable Diffusion WebUI by AUTOMATIC1111, to make development easier, optimize resource management, speed up inference, and study experimental features.
    
    The name "Forge" is inspired by "Minecraft Forge". This project aims to become the Forge of Stable Diffusion WebUI.
    
    "Neo" mainly serves as an continuation for the "latest" version of Forge, which was built on Gradio 4.40.0 before lllyasviel became too busy... Additionally, this fork is focused on optimization and usability, with the main goal of being the lightest WebUI without any bloatwares.
