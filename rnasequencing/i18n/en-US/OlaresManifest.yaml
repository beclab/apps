  description: An end-to-end GPU-powered workflow for scRNA-seq using RAPIDS
spec:
  fullDescription: |
    Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) lets researchers study gene activity in each cell on its own, exposing variation, cell types, and cell states that bulk methods hide. But these large, high-dimensional datasets take heavy compute to handle.
    
    This playbook shows an end-to-end GPU-powered workflow for scRNA-seq using RAPIDS-singlecell, a RAPIDS powered library in the scverse® ecosystem. It follows the familiar Scanpy API and lets researchers run the steps of data preprocessing, quality control (QC) and cleanup, visualization, and investigation faster than CPU tools by working with sparse count matrices directly on the GPU.
