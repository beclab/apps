  fullDescription: |
    WordPress powers more than 43% of the web - a figure that rises every day. Everything from simple websites, to blogs, to complex portals and enterprise websites, and even applications, are built with WordPress.

    WordPress combines simplicity for users and publishers with under-the-hood complexity for developers. This makes it flexible while still being easy-to-use

    Here are some of the features that we think that you'll love.
    - Simplicity
    
    - Flexibility
    you can create any type of website you want: a personal blog or website, a photoblog, a business website, a professional portfolio, a government website, a magazine or news website, an online community, even a network of websites. You can make your website beautiful with themes, and extend it with plugins. You can even build your very own application.

    - Publish with Ease
    You can create Posts and Pages, format them easily, insert media, and with the click of a button your content is live and on the web.

    - Publishing Tools
    Create drafts, schedule publication, and look at your post revisions. Make your content public or private, and secure posts and pages with a password.

    - User Management
    You can have a variety of contributors to your website, and let others simply be part of your community. Administrators manage the site, editors work with content, authors and contributors write that content, and subscribers have a profile that they can manage.

    - Media Management
    You can quickly and easily upload images and media to WordPress. Drag and drop your media into the uploader to add it to your website. Add alt text and captions, and insert images and galleries into your content.There are a few image editing tools you can have fun with.

    - Full Standards Compliance
    Every piece of WordPress generated code is in full compliance with the standards set by the W3C. 

    - Easy Theme System
    WordPress comes bundled with three default themes, but if they aren't for you there's a theme directory with thousands of themes for you to create a beautiful website. 

    - Extend with Plugins
    There's a plugin directory with thousands of plugins. Add complex galleries, social networking, forums, social media widgets, spam protection, calendars, fine-tune controls for search engine optimization, and forms.

    - Built-in Comments
    WordPress's comment tools give you everything you need to be a forum for discussion and to moderate that discussion.

    - Search Engine Optimized
    WordPress is optimized for search engines right out of the box. For more fine-grained SEO control, there are plenty of SEO plugins to take care of that for you.
    
    - Use WordPress in Your Language
    WordPress is available in more than 70 languages. 

    - Easy Installation and Upgrades

    - Importers
    WordPress comes with importers for Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, TypePad, Tumblr, and WordPress. 
    
    - Own Your Data
    Using WordPress means no one has access to your content. Own your data, all of it - your website, your content, your data.

    - Freedom
    WordPress is licensed under the GPL which was created to protect your freedoms.
    
    - Community
    As the most popular open source CMS on the web, WordPress has a vibrant and supportive community.

    WordPress 6.4.2 is now available!

    This minor release features 7 bug fixes in Core. The fixes include a bug fix for
    an issue causing stylesheet and theme directories to sometimes return incorrect
    results.

    This release also features one security fix. Because this is a security release,
    it is recommended that you update your sites immediately.

    The security team addressed the following vulnerability in this release.

    - A Remote Code Execution vulnerability that is not directly exploitable in core,
    however the security team feels that there is a potential for high severity when
    combined with some plugins, especially in multisite installs.
