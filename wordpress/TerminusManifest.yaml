    \ for Blogger, LiveJournal, Movable Type, TypePad, Tumblr, and WordPress. \n\n\
    \n- Own Your Data\nUsing WordPress means no one has access to your content. Own\
    \ your data, all of it \u2014 your website, your content, your data.\n\n- Freedom\n\
    WordPress is licensed under the GPL which was created to protect your freedoms.\n\
    \n- Community\nAs the most popular open source CMS on the web, WordPress has a\
    \ vibrant and supportive community. \n\n- Contribute\nYou can be WordPress too!\
