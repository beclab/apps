  fullDescription: |
    Meet Plane, an open-source project management tool to track issues, run cycles, and manage product roadmaps without the chaos of managing the tool itself.

    Features
    Issues Efficiently create and manage tasks with a robust rich text editor that supports file uploads. Enhance organization and tracking by adding sub-properties and referencing related issues.

    Cycles Maintain your team's momentum with Cycles. Track progress effortlessly using burn-down charts and other insightful tools.

    Modules Simplify complex projects by dividing them into smaller, manageable modules.

    Views Customize your workflow by creating filters to display only the most relevant issues. Save and share these views with ease.

    Pages Capture and organize ideas using Plane Pages, complete with AI capabilities and a rich text editor. Format text, insert images, add hyperlinks, or convert your notes into actionable items.

    Analytics Access real-time insights across all your Plane data. Visualize trends, remove blockers, and keep your projects moving forward.

    Drive (coming soon): The drive helps you share documents, images, videos, or any other files that make sense to you or your team and align on the problem/solution.
