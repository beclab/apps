    Home Assistant provides open source home automation that puts local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a local server.

    Features
    # Works with over 1000 brands
    Home Assistant integrates with over a thousand different devices and services. Once started, Home Assistant will automatically scan your network for known devices and allow you to easily set them up.

    # Powerful automations
    Once you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash Home Assistant\u2019s advanced automation engine to make your home work for you.

    # Extend your system with add-ons
    Home Assistant is not just limited to Home Assistant. Easily install other applications that will help you manage your home.

    # All your smart home data stays local
    Home Assistant communicates with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything is processed locally.

    # Companion Mobile Apps
    Use the official Home Assistant apps, a convenient companion to quickly control your devices and be notified when things happen in your home, even on your wrist using the Apple Watch.

    The apps can also be used to send your location home to use presence detection as part of your automations. Data is sent directly to your home, no access by third-parties.

    # Home Energy Management
    Home Assistant allows you to get on top of your energy use with its home energy management feature. Gain new insights, optimize your solar panel production, plan energy usage and save money.
