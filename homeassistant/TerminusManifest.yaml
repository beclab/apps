    \ local control and privacy first. Powered by a worldwide community of tinkerers\
    \ and DIY enthusiasts. Perfect to run on a local server.\n\nFeatures\n# Works\
    \ with over 1000 brands\nHome Assistant integrates with over a thousand different\
    \ devices and services. Once started, Home Assistant will automatically scan your\
    \ network for known devices and allow you to easily set them up.\n\n# Powerful\
    \ automations\nOnce you have integrated all your devices at home, you can unleash\
    \ Home Assistant\u2019s advanced automation engine to make your home work for\
    \ you.\n\n# Extend your system with add-ons\nHome Assistant is not just limited\
    \ to Home Assistant. Easily install other applications that will help you manage\
    \ your home.\n\n# All your smart home data stays local\nHome Assistant communicates\
    \ with your devices locally, and will fallback to pulling in data from the cloud\
    \ if there is no other option. No data is stored in the cloud, and everything\
    \ is processed locally.\n\n# Companion Mobile Apps\nUse the official Home Assistant\
    \ apps, a convenient companion to quickly control your devices and be notified\
    \ when things happen in your home, even on your wrist using the Apple Watch.\n\
    The apps can also be used to send your location home to use presence detection\
    \ as part of your automations. Data is sent directly to your home, no access by\
    \ third-parties.\n\n# Home Energy Management\nHome Assistant allows you to get\
    \ on top of your energy use with its home energy management feature. Gain new\
    \ insights, optimize your solar panel production, plan energy usage and save money.\n"
