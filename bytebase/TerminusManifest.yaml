  fullDescription: "Bytebase is an open-source database DevOps tool, it's the GitLab/GitHub\
    \ for managing databases throughout the application development lifecycle. It\
    \ offers a web-based collaboration workspace for DBAs, Developers and platform\
    \ engineers.\n\n## HIGHLIGHTS ## \nDifferent database development tasks\nMultiple\
    \ database systems\nUnified process\nSingle tool\n\n\n## KEY FEATURES ##\n* SQL\
    \ Review\n  Bytebase analyzes SQL changes to enforce rules in compliance with\
    \ your organization's policy. The enforcement includes naming conventions, anti-SQL\
    \ pattern detection and etc. Prod and non-prod environments can also enforce different\
    \ rules respectively.\n\n* Database CI/CD and Change Automation\n  Like code review,\
    \ Bytebase streamlines the database change process. Within a single workflow,\
    \ a database change can be reviewed and deployed from the dev environment all\
    \ the way to the production environment.\n\n* GitOps (Database-as-Code)\n  Bytebase\
    \ keeps the complete schema change history. It also integrates with VCS systems.\
    \ Teams can manage the SQL migration scripts in the VCS and trigger schema deployment\
    \ on code commit.\n\n* Batch Change and Query\n  Bytebase allows you to change\
    \ a collection of databases in a single workflow. It also allows you to issue\
    \ a single query against multiple databases.\n\n* SQL Editor\n  A web-based SQL\
    \ Editor to query and export data. DBAs no longer need to give away sensitive\
    \ database credentials when developers need to access the data.\n\n* Dynamic Data\
    \ Masking\n  Bytebase provides multi-level masking policy with workflow to grant\
    \ unmasked data access.\n\n* Data Access Control\n  Bytebase provides a suite\
    \ of features to enable organizations to enforce data security policies, avoid\
    \ data leaks and conform compliance.\n\n* Data Rollback and Disaster Recovery\n\
    \  - Statement-level rollback\n  - Database-level manual and periodical backup\
    \ and restore\n  - Point-in-time recovery (PITR)\n"
  upgradeDescription: "Features:\n  * Support backing up data before the DML is performed\
    \ for MySQL.\n  * Support instance maximum connections, allowing control over\
    \ the number of concurrent tasks per instance.\n  * Support compression and encryption\
    \ for exported data.\n\nBreaking Changes:\n  * Changes in Bytebase API: Renamed\
    \ predefined roles. Update your code if you are utilizing these roles\n    - Workspace\
    \ level: OWNER->workspaceAdmin, DBA->workspaceDBA, DEVELOPER->workspaceMember\n\
    \    - Project level: OWNER->projectOwner, DEVELOPER->projectDeveloper, QUERIER->projectQuerier,\
    \ EXPORTER->projectExporter, VIEWER->projectViewer, RELEASER->projectReleaser\n\
    \nEnhancements\n  * Support editing indexes in Schema Editor.\n  * In SQL Editor,\
    \ group sheets by project and database.\n  * Support choosing custom project roles\
    \ in environment rollout policy.\n\nView full release note here: https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase/releases/tag/2.13.1\n"
