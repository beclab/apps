    ## HIGHLIGHTS ## 
    Different database development tasks
    Multiple database systems
    Unified process
    Single tool

    ## KEY FEATURES ##
    * SQL Review
      Bytebase analyzes SQL changes to enforce rules in compliance with your organization's policy. The enforcement includes naming conventions, anti-SQL pattern detection and etc. Prod and non-prod environments can also enforce different rules respectively.
    * Database CI/CD and Change Automation
      Like code review, Bytebase streamlines the database change process. Within a single workflow, a database change can be reviewed and deployed from the dev environment all the way to the production environment.
    * GitOps (Database-as-Code)
      Bytebase keeps the complete schema change history. It also integrates with VCS systems. Teams can manage the SQL migration scripts in the VCS and trigger schema deployment on code commit.
    * Batch Change and Query
      Bytebase allows you to change a collection of databases in a single workflow. It also allows you to issue a single query against multiple databases.
    * SQL Editor
      A web-based SQL Editor to query and export data. DBAs no longer need to give away sensitive database credentials when developers need to access the data.
    * Dynamic Data Masking
      Bytebase provides multi-level masking policy with workflow to grant unmasked data access.
    * Data Access Control
      Bytebase provides a suite of features to enable organizations to enforce data security policies, avoid data leaks and conform compliance.
    * Data Rollback and Disaster Recovery
      - Statement-level rollback
      - Database-level manual and periodical backup and restore
      - Point-in-time recovery (PITR)
