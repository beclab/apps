  fullDescription: |
    IPFS is an open system to manage data without a central server.
    This is a web interface to IPFS, shipped with Kubo, and ipfs-desktop.
    Check on your node stats, explore the IPLD powered merkle forest, see peers around the world and manage your files, without needing to touch the CLI.

    # IMPORTANT NOTE
    If you encounter an error stating "could not connect to the IPFS API" when starting IPFS for the first time, please follow the common fixes listed on the welcome page. To enter the CLI command, navigate to ControlHub. Then, in the 'ipfs' pod, open the Terminal.
    You may need to submit your RPC API ADDRESS: https://35853774.<your-terminus-name>.myterminus.com/

    # Why IPFS?
    Open
    - The IPFS network is distributed and participatory, which reduces the problem of data silos that plague central servers.
    
    Verifiable:
    - The integrity of all data is verified using hash functions, so you can trust that you always get the data you're looking for.
    
    Resilient
    - Files and data can be stored across multiple nodes, which keeps content at the ready even during critical outages.
