    MTranServer is a high-performance offline translation server with minimal resource requirements.
    
    It runs on CPU with just 1GB memory, no GPU needed. Average response time of 50ms per request. Supports translation of major languages worldwide.

    Note: This model focuses on speed and private deployment on various devices, so the translation quality will not match that of large language models.For high-quality translation, consider using online large language model APIs.
