    ## OVERVIEW ##  
    NocoBase is an extensibility-first, open-source no-code development platform.

    Features

    Data model-driven
    - Decouple data and UI
    - Multiple blocks and actions can be created for the same table and record in any quantity and form
    - Support main database, external databases, and third-party APIs as data sources

    What you see is what you get
    - One-click switch between usage mode and configuration mode
    - Pages serve as a canvas where various blocks and actions are placed to compose suitable interfaces, much like Notion
    - The UI configuration mode is designed for ordinary users, not programmers

    Everything is implemented as plugins, designed for extension development
    - Adopts a microkernel architecture where all functionalities are plugins, much like Wordpress
    - Plugins are ready to use upon installation
    - Whether they are pages, blocks, actions, APIs, or data sources, new plugins can be developed to meet new requirements

    Logging & Monitoring
    - The logging plugin offers interface request logs and system operation logs
    - Supporting configurations such as log levels, rolling policies, size, and print formats
    - A series of telemetry plugins integrate facilities like OpenTelemetry and Prometheus, enabling developers to monitor any metric

    Integrate with third-party systems
    - Using third-party databases as data sources
    - Utilizing APIs from other systems as data sources
    - Single Sign-On (SSO) for seamless authentication
    - Integrate seamlessly with third-party systems, becoming one entity
    - Implement multi-applications and parent-child applications among multiple NocoBase applications
