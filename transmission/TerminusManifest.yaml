  fullDescription: "Transmission is a fast, easy, and free BitTorrent client. \n\n\
    # Features\n## Easy & Powerful\nTransmission is designed for easy, powerful use.\
    \ We've set the defaults to just work and it only takes a few clicks to configure\
    \ advanced features like watch directories, bad peer blocklists, and the web interface.\
    \ \n\n## Native for Your System\nUnlike many cross-platform applications, Transmission\
    \ integrates seamlessly with your operating system.\n\n## Lightweight & Lightning\
    \ Fast\nTransmission has one of the lowest memory & resource footprints of any\
    \ major BitTorrent client. Transmission's light overhead is one reason why it\
    \ is so well suited for home NAS and media servers.\n\n## Open Source & Privacy\
    \ Focused\nUnlike some BitTorrent clients, Transmission doesn't play games with\
    \ its users to make money: Transmission doesn't bundle toolbars, pop-up ads, flash\
    \ ads, twitter tools, or anything else. It doesn't hold some features back for\
    \ a payware version. Its source code is available for anyone to review. We don't\
    \ track our users, and our website and forums have no third-party ads or analytics.\n\
    \n## Sleek & Feature Rich\nThe features you want from a BitTorrent client with\
    \ an easy-to-use interface: privacy protection, a web interface, full peer communications,\
    \ tracker editing, speed limits, and more.\n"
