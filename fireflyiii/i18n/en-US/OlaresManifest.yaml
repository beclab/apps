  description: A personal finances manager
spec:
  fullDescription: |
    Firefly III is a (self-hosted) manager for your personal finances. It can help you keep track of your expenses and income, so you can spend less and save more. Firefly III supports the use of budgets, categories and tags. Using a bunch of external tools, you can import data. It also has many neat financial reports available.

    Firefly III should give you insight into and control over your finances. Money should be useful, not scary. You should be able to see where it is going, to feel your expenses and to... wow, I'm going overboard with this aren't I?

    But you get the idea: this is your money. These are your expenses. Stop them from controlling you. I built this tool because I started to dislike money. Having money, not having money, paying bills with money, you get the idea. But no more. I want to feel "safe", whatever my balance is. And I hope this tool can help you. I know it helps me

    Features
    Firefly III is pretty feature packed. Some important stuff first:
    - It is completely self-hosted and isolated, and will never contact external servers until you explicitly tell it to.
    - It features a REST JSON API that covers almost every part of Firefly III.

    The most exciting features are:
    - Create recurring transactions to manage your money.
    - Rule based transaction handling with the ability to create your own rules.

    Then the things that make you go "yeah OK, makes sense".
    - A double-entry bookkeeping system.
    - Save towards a goal using piggy banks.
    - View income and expense reports.

    And the things you would hope for but not expect:
    - 2 factor authentication for extra security.
    - Supports any currency you want.

    And to organise everything:
    - Clear views that should show you how you're doing.
    - Easy navigation through your records.
    - Lots of charts because we all love them.
