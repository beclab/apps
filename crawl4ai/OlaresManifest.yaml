    # Features
    Markdown Generation
    - Clean Markdown: Generates clean, structured Markdown with accurate formatting.
    - Fit Markdown: Heuristic-based filtering to remove noise and irrelevant parts for AI-friendly processing.
    - Citations and References: Converts page links into a numbered reference list with clean citations.
    - Custom Strategies: Users can create their own Markdown generation strategies tailored to specific needs.
    - BM25 Algorithm: Employs BM25-based filtering for extracting core information and removing irrelevant content.

    Structured Data Extraction
    - LLM-Driven Extraction: Supports all LLMs (open-source and proprietary) for structured data extraction.
    - Chunking Strategies: Implements chunking (topic-based, regex, sentence-level) for targeted content processing.
    - Cosine Similarity: Find relevant content chunks based on user queries for semantic extraction.
    - CSS-Based Extraction: Fast schema-based data extraction using XPath and CSS selectors.
    - Schema Definition: Define custom schemas for extracting structured JSON from repetitive patterns.

    Browser Integration
    - Managed Browser: Use user-owned browsers with full control, avoiding bot detection.
    - Remote Browser Control: Connect to Chrome Developer Tools Protocol for remote, large-scale data extraction.
    - Browser Profiler: Create and manage persistent profiles with saved authentication states, cookies, and settings.
    - Session Management: Preserve browser states and reuse them for multi-step crawling.
    - Proxy Support: Seamlessly connect to proxies with authentication for secure access.
    - Full Browser Control: Modify headers, cookies, user agents, and more for tailored crawling setups.
    - Multi-Browser Support: Compatible with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
    - Dynamic Viewport Adjustment: Automatically adjusts the browser viewport to match page content, ensuring complete rendering and capturing of all elements.

    Crawling & Scraping
    - Media Support: Extract images, audio, videos, and responsive image formats like srcset and picture.
    - Dynamic Crawling: Execute JS and wait for async or sync for dynamic content extraction.
    - Screenshots: Capture page screenshots during crawling for debugging or analysis.
    - Raw Data Crawling: Directly process raw HTML (raw:) or local files (file://).
    - Comprehensive Link Extraction: Extracts internal, external links, and embedded iframe content.
    - Customizable Hooks: Define hooks at every step to customize crawling behavior.
    - Caching: Cache data for improved speed and to avoid redundant fetches.
    - Metadata Extraction: Retrieve structured metadata from web pages.
    - IFrame Content Extraction: Seamless extraction from embedded iframe content.
    - Lazy Load Handling: Waits for images to fully load, ensuring no content is missed due to lazy loading.
    - Full-Page Scanning: Simulates scrolling to load and capture all dynamic content, perfect for infinite scroll pages.

    Deployment
    - Dockerized Setup: Optimized Docker image with FastAPI server for easy deployment.
    - Secure Authentication: Built-in JWT token authentication for API security.
    - API Gateway: One-click deployment with secure token authentication for API-based workflows.
    - Scalable Architecture: Designed for mass-scale production and optimized server performance.
    - Cloud Deployment: Ready-to-deploy configurations for major cloud platforms.

    Additional Features
    - Stealth Mode: Avoid bot detection by mimicking real users.
    - Tag-Based Content Extraction: Refine crawling based on custom tags, headers, or metadata.
    - Link Analysis: Extract and analyze all links for detailed data exploration.
    - Error Handling: Robust error management for seamless execution.
