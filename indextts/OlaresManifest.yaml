  fullDescription: |
    IndexTTS2 is a breakthrough in emotionally expressive and duration-controlled auto-regressive zero-shot Text-to-Speech. It is a powerful and flexible TTS system that combines high-quality, natural-sounding speech with unprecedented control over duration and emotion, making it suitable for demanding industrial applications.

    # Key Features and Capabilities
    Precise Duration Control
    IndexTTS2 supports two generation modes: explicitly specifies the number of tokens for precise duration control, or generates speech freely in a standard autoregressive manner while maintaining the prosody of the input prompt.

    Emotion and Speaker Disentanglement
    The model effectively separates emotional expression from speaker identity, enabling independent control over timbre and emotion

    Multi-Modal Emotion Control
    Emotion can be controlled through various inputs:
    - An audio prompt conveying the desired emotion.
    - An emotion vector specifying intensities for different emotions (happy, angry, sad, etc.).
    - A text description of the emotion, facilitated by a fine-tuned language model (Qwen3) that converts text into emotional guidance.

    Enhanced Clarity and Stability
    The architecture incorporates GPT latent representations and uses a three-stage training paradigm to enhance the stability of the generated audio.

    High Performance
    Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS models in Word Error Rate (WER), speaker similarity, and emotional fidelity.
