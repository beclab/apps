  upgradeDescription: "This version resolves a single issue with a database migration.\n\
    \n## Important notes on upgrading ##\nThis version fixes an issue with an existing\
    \ migration that prevented upgrades from completing. It does not include any new\
    \ migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.\n\
    Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,\
    \ and start again, no matter how \u201Cbig\u201D or \u201Csmall\u201D the upgrade\
    \ is. This behavior can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure\
    \ file, which is only used for updates.\n\nCheck out the release note for more\
    \ information: https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2024/01/12/gitlab-16-7-3-released/\n"
