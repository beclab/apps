  fullDescription: |    
    We present ACE-Step v1.5, a highly efficient open-source music foundation model that brings commercial-grade generation to consumer hardware. On commonly used evaluation metrics, ACE-Step v1.5 achieves quality beyond most commercial music models while remaining extremely fast—under 2 seconds per full song on an A100 and under 10 seconds on an RTX 3090. The model runs locally with less than 4GB of VRAM, and supports lightweight personalization: users can train a LoRA from just a few songs to capture their own style.
