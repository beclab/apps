  fullDescription: |
    Mattermost is an open source platform for secure collaboration across the entire software development lifecycle. It provides you secure enterprise collaboration with full control over your data.

    Why Mattermost?
    Boosting teams' productivity everywhere they go
    - A single point of collaboration. Designed specifically for digital operations.

    Uniting devs, ops and everything in between
    - Mattermost empowers technical and operational teams to collaborate without sacrificing security.

    Channels
    - All of your team's communications in one place. Go beyond general-purpose collaboration to include automation, slash commands, bot integrations, code snippets, and more.

    Playbooks
    - Orchestrate work across your tools and teams for processes that need both collaboration and structure. Playbooks are prescribed workflows that support specific digital operations scenarios and use cases that require reliable and repeatable processes.

    Calls
    - Connect your team securely in real-time with native voice calls on Channels. From launching incident war rooms to pair programming and team standups, Calls lets you start the conversation in a click.

    Connections
    - Customize and extend your platform by integrating with the tools your team relies on every day. Use deep integrations with popular SaaS tools, find community-built integrations, or build your own with our Plugin Framework and open APIs.

    Controls
    - Choose from secure cloud or on-premise deployment and stay in complete control of your data. Custom security, compliance, and access controls ensure your data stays where you want it, and nowhere else.
