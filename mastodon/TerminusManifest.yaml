  fullDescription: "Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on\
    \ ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones.\n\nOn Mastodon,\
    \ users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All\
    \ Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server\
    \ can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon\
    \ software that implements ActivityPub!)\n\nFeatures\n* No vendor lock-in: Fully\
    \ interoperable with any conforming platform\n>   It doesn't have to be Mastodon;\
    \ whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network!\n\n* Real-time,\
    \ chronological timeline updates\n>   Updates of people you're following appear\
    \ in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!\n\n\
    * Media attachments like images and short videos\n>   Upload and view images and\
    \ WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated\
    \ like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!\n\n\n\n* Safety and moderation tools\n\
    >   Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting,\
    \ blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation\
    \ system.\n\n* OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API\n>   Mastodon acts as an\
    \ OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This\
    \ results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!\n\n\n## IMPORTANT NOTE\
    \ ##\nAfter installed your own Mastodon-powered website, PLEASE CHANGE YOUR ADMIN\
    \ ACCOUNT!!\nThe default admin account: \nUsername: mastodon\nEmail: user@example.com\n\
    Password: \"qwer1234\"\n"
