  fullDescription: |
    Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones.

    On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

    Features
    * No vendor lock-in: Fully interoperable with any conforming platform
    > It doesn't have to be Mastodon; whatever implements ActivityPub is part of the social network!

    * Real-time, chronological timeline updates
    >   Updates of people you're following appear in real-time in the UI via WebSockets. There's a firehose view as well!

    * Media attachments like images and short videos
    > Upload and view images and WebM/MP4 videos attached to the updates. Videos with no audio track are treated like GIFs; normal videos loop continuously!

    * Safety and moderation tools
    > Mastodon includes private posts, locked accounts, phrase filtering, muting, blocking, and all sorts of other features, along with a reporting and moderation system.

    * OAuth2 and a straightforward REST API
    > Mastodon acts as an OAuth2 provider, so 3rd party apps can use the REST and Streaming APIs. This results in a rich app ecosystem with a lot of choices!
