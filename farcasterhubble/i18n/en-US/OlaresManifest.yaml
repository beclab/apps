  fullDescription: |
    Hubble is an implementation of a Farcaster Hub, written in TypeScript and Rust.

    Hubble creates a private instance of the Farcaster network on your machine. It stores a copy of every message from every user and syncs with other hubs to stay up to date. Messages uploaded to Hubble will be broadcast to other Hubs.
