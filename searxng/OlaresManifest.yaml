    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is a shared app. Only one service will be installed across the entire Olares system. However, every user still needs to install an desktop entry to access and use the service installed by the Olares Admin.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    SearXNG is a free internet metasearch engine which aggregates results from more than 70 search services. Users are neither tracked nor profiled. Additionally, SearXNG can be used over Tor for online anonymity.

    - SearXNG is free software, the code is 100% open, and everyone is welcome to make it bette
