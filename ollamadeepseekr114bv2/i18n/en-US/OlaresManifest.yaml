    ## MODEL OVERVIEW ##
    DeepSeek-R1 has received a minor version upgrade to DeepSeek-R1-0528 for the 8 billion parameter distilled model and the full 671 billion parameter model. In this update, DeepSeek R1 has significantly improved its reasoning and inference capabilities. The model has demonstrated outstanding performance across various benchmark evaluations, including mathematics, programming, and general logic. Its overall performance is now approaching that of leading models, such as O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
