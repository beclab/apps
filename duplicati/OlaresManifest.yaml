  fullDescription: |
    Duplicati is a free, open-source backup client that securely stores encrypted, incremental, and compressed backups on cloud storage services and remote file servers. It supports:

    Features
    - Duplicati uses AES-256 encryption (or GNU Privacy Guard) to secure all data before uploading.
    - Initial full backup followed by smaller, incremental updates to save bandwidth and storage.
    - Built-in scheduler ensures backups stay up-to-date automatically.
    - An integrated updater notifies you of new releases.
    - Encrypted backups can be transferred to destinations like FTP, WebDAV, SSH (SFTP), Amazon S3, and more.
    - Flexible backup options: back up folders, specific file types (e.g., documents or images), or use custom filters.
    - Available as a user-friendly application or a command-line tool.
    - Supports backing up open or locked files using Volume Snapshot Service (VSS) on Windows or Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Linux.
    - Advanced options for filters, deletion rules, transfer settings, bandwidth limits, and more.

    Upgrade app version to 2.2.0.102

    Changes in this versions
    - This release makes the S3 providers simpler to use by providing fewer options, and only showing relevant endpoints.
    - The release also adds support for excluding files based on extended attributes on Linux and MacOS, and adds support for supplementary access groups on Linux.
    - For Windows, the installer now supports NOSCRIPT=true which will prevent the installer from running scripts that start/stop the Windows service.
    - It is now also possible to change the encryption passphrase for a backup, using the RecoveryTool.
