  fullDescription: "This is an official Golang execution layer implementation of the\
    \ Ethereum protocol.\n\nTake full control. Run your own node. Become fully sovereign\
    \ while helping secure the network. Become Ethereum.\n\nChoosing to run a full\
    \ node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to. Running a full\
    \ node: \n* Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based\
    \ networks\n* Authoritatively validates all transactions\n* Can interact with\
    \ any contract on the public blockchain without an intermediary\n* Can directly\
    \ deploy contracts into the public blockchain without an intermediary\n* Can query\
    \ (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline\n* Can\
    \ query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you\u2019\
    re reading\n\n# Be Aware #\nRunning a full node requires significant and growing\
    \ hardware and bandwidth resources, which will incur some mild to moderate costs\
    \ for you. A full node may download up to 300 GB of data (as of March 2021, depending\
    \ on the client configuration) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden\
    \ increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added.\
    \ You can check detail hardware requirements in the link below.\nhttps://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/03clients.asciidoc#requirements\n\
    \n# Who should run a node? #\nEveryone! Nodes are not just for proof-of-stake\
    \ validators. Anyone can run a node\u2014you don't even need ETH.\n\nDon't trust.\
    \ Verify.\n"
  upgradeDescription: 'This release fixes a few issues and enables the Cancun upgrade
    for the Goerli network at block timestamp 1705473120 (#28719) which is 6:32:am
    17. Jan. 2024 UTC.


    If you are running Goerli, this is a required update!


    Apart from the Goerli configuration update, we have a few other changes.

    - The ''simulated backend'' in package accounts/abi/backends was rewritten. The
    improved version is available from the new package ethclient/simulated. A backwards-compatibility
    wrapper remains in the old location. (#28202)

    - Fix ABI-encoding of negative big.Int in topics (#28764)

    - In JSON logging output, the "error" level is now correctly emitted as "error".
    (#28774, #28780)

    - Fixed an issue with configuration of stdlib package log for consumers of the
    geth library (#28747)

    - geth removedb can now be run non-interactively (#28725)

    - We''re building a package for ubuntu 23.10: mantic minotaur now (#28728)
