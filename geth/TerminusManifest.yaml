  fullDescription: |
    This is an official Golang execution layer implementation of the Ethereum protocol.
    Take full control.
    Run your own node.
    Become fully sovereign while helping secure the network.
    Become Ethereum.

    Choosing to run a full node helps with the operation of the networks you connect it to.

    Running a full node:
    * Supports the resilience and censorship resistance of Ethereum-based networks
    * Authoritatively validates all transactions
    * Can interact with any contract on the public blockchain without an intermediary
    * Can directly deploy contracts into the public blockchain without an intermediary
    * Can query (read-only) the blockchain status (accounts, contracts, etc.) offline
    * Can query the blockchain without letting a third party know the information you're reading

    # Be Aware #
    Running a full node requires significant and growing hardware and bandwidth resources, which will incur some mild to moderate costs for you. A full node may download up to 300 GB of data (as of March 2021, depending on the client configuration) and store it on a local hard drive. This data burden increases quite rapidly every day as new transactions and blocks are added.

    You can check detail hardware requirements in the link below.

    # Who should run a node? #
    Everyone! Nodes are not just for proof-of-stake
    validators. Anyone can run a node, you don't even need ETH.

    Don't trust.
    Verify.

  upgradeDescription: |
    This release fixes a few issues and enables the Cancun upgrade for the Goerli network at block timestamp 1705473120 (#28719) which is 6:32:am 17. Jan. 2024 UTC.

    If you are running Goerli, this is a required update!

    Apart from the Goerli configuration update, we have a few other changes.
    - The ''simulated backend'' in package accounts/abi/backends was rewritten. The
    improved version is available from the new package ethclient/simulated. A backwards-compatibility
    wrapper remains in the old location. (#28202)

    - Fix ABI-encoding of negative big.Int in topics (#28764)

    - In JSON logging output, the "error" level is now correctly emitted as "error".
    (#28774, #28780)

    - Fixed an issue with configuration of stdlib package log for consumers of the
    geth library (#28747)

    - geth removedb can now be run non-interactively (#28725)

    - We're building a package for ubuntu 23.10: mantic minotaur now (#28728)
