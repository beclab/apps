spec:
  fullDescription: |
    Run VS Code on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.
    Highlights:
    * Code on any device with a consistent development environment.
    * Use cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.
    * Preserve battery life when you''''re on the go; all intensive tasks run on your
    server.
    * VS Code features are supported but not all extensions

    code-server is an open-source project that transforms Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    into a server, enabling it to run on any machine. As a result, developers can
    access VS Code from any device with an internet connection, opening up new possibilities
    for remote development.

    code-server stands out for its compatibility with most VS Code extensions. This
    feature allows developers to tailor their coding environment to their specific
    needs, even when working remotely

    One of code-server''s significant advantages is maintaining a consistent development
    environment across diverse devices, reducing issues with code behaving differently
    on various machines.
