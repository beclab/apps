  fullDescription: |
    The Hasura engine is an open source project which supercharges the building of modern applications by providing access to data via a single, composable, secure API endpoint.
    
    # Accelerate API development
    With a metadata-driven approach, Hasura slashes the time and effort it takes to set up and maintain a robust API (GraphQL, REST, etc) on your data.
    Streamline every step of the API lifecycle to effortlessly deliver an access layer that unlocks your data.
    - Domain to API in minutes
    - Effortless API evolution
    - Peak performance. Zero effort.

    # Low-code metadata-driven, domain-driven APIs
    Connect - Hasura introspects your domain and generates the metadata that powers the API. This metadata captures the data-to-API mapping and serves as a fully customizable blueprint for your API.
    Query - At runtime, the Hasura engine acts like a compiler that dynamically translates the API request into the most efficient and compact query in the “language” the upstream data sources understand.

    # One incredible API for all your data.
    Hasura generates a standardized, self-documented API with incredible composability. Search, discover, understand, and flexibly compose only the data you need in a single go – no matter which domain the data comes from or how it’s stored.
    - Impossibly good composability
    - No more waiting on API features
    - Visualize, discover, explore

    # We have a connector for that
    With a rich ecosystem of open source native data connectors, and the ability to build your own, getting a powerful API on your data, or adding your data into an existing supergraph API is a step way.

    # Granular access control
    Configure role-based privileges down to the field level access directly in Hasura or populate from your existing authorization system to safely expose the API to developers inside or outside your organization.

    # Experience that developers will love
    Hasura fits right into your existing CI/CD workflows, enabling developers to rapidly build and iterate on your API – without breaking things.

    # Streamline collaboration across domain teams
    With a federated governance model, multiple domain teams can collaboratively build and evolve the unified supergraph API. Domain teams can move fast with autonomy and speed, while being compliant with centralized governance norms.

    # No blind spots
    Stay ahead of issues and continually improve your API with detailed performance, tracing, and usage data

    # Continuity, ensured.
    Hasura instantly deploys the API on a global serverless runtime infrastructure. Get operational guarantees on reliability, performance, and scale, without the operational work.
