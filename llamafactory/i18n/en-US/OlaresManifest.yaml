  fullDescription: |
    LlamaFactory, a unified framework that integrates a suite of cutting-edge efficient training methods. It provides a solution for flexibly customizing the fine-tuning of 100+ LLMs without the need for coding through the built-in web UI LlamaBoard.

    Features  
    - Various models: LLaMA, LLaVA, Mistral, Mixtral-MoE, Qwen, Yi, Gemma, Baichuan, ChatGLM, Phi, etc.
    - Integrated methods: (Continuous) pre-training, (multimodal) supervised fine-tuning, reward modeling, PPO, DPO, KTO, ORPO, etc.
    - Scalable resources: 16-bit full-tuning, freeze-tuning, LoRA and 2/3/4/5/6/8-bit QLoRA via AQLM/AWQ/GPTQ/LLM.int8/HQQ/EETQ.
    - Advanced algorithms: GaLore, BAdam, Adam-mini, DoRA, LongLoRA, LLaMA Pro, Mixture-of-Depths, LoRA+, LoftQ, PiSSA and Agent tuning.
    - Practical tricks: FlashAttention-2, Unsloth, RoPE scaling, NEFTune and rsLoRA.
    - Experiment monitors: LlamaBoard, TensorBoard, Wandb, MLflow, etc.
    - Faster inference: OpenAI-style API, Gradio UI and CLI with vLLM worker.
