    # Overview    
    MiGPT makes your smart home understand you better by perfectly integrating Xiaomi Smart Speaker, Mijia smart devices, and ChatGPT's understanding ability. MiGPT is not only about device automation, but also about: building a home that understands you, has warmth, and evolves with you.

    In this digital world, home is not just a place to live, but an extension of our digital life. In the future, each of your smart home devices, from light bulbs, sockets, to sweeping robots, TVs, etc., can be an independent agent to respond to your instructions more intelligently and attentively. These independent agents can also sense and cooperate with each other to form a more powerful collaborative network. And Xiaoai speakers are like your exclusive smart home butler, serving you wholeheartedly and unleashing the true potential of smart homes.

    Feature highlights
    - AI Q&A. Imagine that when Xiaoai speakers are connected to the big model, they know astronomy and geography, and they can change from "artificial mental retardation" to academic masters in seconds.
    - Role playing. It only takes one second to train Xiao Ai, whether it is to be your perfect partner or the intimate bestie who can listen to your heartfelt talk, it is no problem.
    - Streaming response. Love comes too fast like a tornado, and your Xiao Ai speaker is the same. It responds to your love in seconds and loves you without making you wait too long.
    - Long and short-term memory. Xiao Ai speaker can now remember every conversation between you, and the more you talk, the more tacit understanding you have, just like an old friend around you.
    - Custom TTS. Tired of Xiao Ai's voice? Help you unlock the same voice as "Dou Bao", just like a real person replying to your message.  developer: idootop
