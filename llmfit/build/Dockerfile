# STAGE 2: Build Rust llmfit Executable
# =========================================================
# rustc >= 1.95 required: sysinfo 0.39.x bumped its MSRV to 1.95.
# Pin the Debian release to match the runtime stage (bookworm). The default
# rust:1.95-slim base tracks trixie (glibc 2.39), which links the binary
# against symbols the bookworm runtime (glibc 2.36) does not provide, so the
# binary fails to start with "GLIBC_2.39 not found". Keep both stages on the
# same release so the linked glibc is always available at runtime.
#
# Each platform is built natively: the Docker workflow runs one job per
# platform on a matching runner, so the builder image is always the host's
# own architecture. Do not pin `--platform=$BUILDPLATFORM` here. Declaring
# BUILDPLATFORM with a default overrode the value buildx supplies, which
# pulled the amd64 toolchain onto the arm64 runner and ran rustc under QEMU
# user-mode emulation, where it segfaults (v1.1.13 release failure).
