  fullDescription: |
    JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.

    # Key Features
    Customizable
    - JupyterHub can be used to serve a variety of environments. It supports dozens of kernels with the Jupyter server, and can be used to serve a variety of user interfaces including the Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, RStudio, nteract, and more.

    Flexible
    - JupyterHub can be configured with authentication in order to provide access to a subset of users. Authentication is pluggable, supporting a number of authentication protocols (such as OAuth and GitHub).

    Scalable
    - JupyterHub is container-friendly, and can be deployed with modern-day container technology. It also runs on Kubernetes, and can run with up to tens of thousands of users.

    Portable
    - JupyterHub is entirely open-source and designed to be run on a variety of infrastructure. This includes commercial cloud providers, virtual machines, or even your own laptop hardware.
