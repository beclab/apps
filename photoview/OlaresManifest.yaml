  fullDescription: |
    Photoview is a simple and user-friendly photo gallery that's made for photographers and aims to provide an easy and fast way to navigate directories, with thousands of high-resolution photos.

    You configure Photoview to look for photos and videos within a directory on your file system. The scanner automatically picks up your media and start to generate thumbnail images to make browsing super fast.

    When your media has been scanned they show up on the website, organised in the same way as on the filesystem

    # Main features
    ## Closely tied to the file system.
    The website presents the images found on the local filesystem of the server, directories are mapped to albums.

    ## User management.
    Each user is created along with a path on the local filesystem, photos within that path can be accessed by that user.

    ## Sharing.
    Albums, as well as individual media, can easily be shared with a public link, the link can optionally be password protected.

    ## Made for photography.
    Photoview is built with photographers in mind, and thus supports RAW file formats, and EXIF parsing.

    ## Video support.
    Many common video formats are supported. Videos will automatically be optimized for web.

    ## Face recognition.
    Faces will automatically be detected in photos, and photos of the same person will be grouped together.

    ## Performant.
    Thumbnails are automatically generated and photos first load when they are visible on the screen. In full screen, thumbnails are displayed until the high resolution image has been fully loaded.

    ## Secure.
    All media resources are protected with a cookie-token, all passwords are properly hashed, and the API uses a strict CORS policy.
