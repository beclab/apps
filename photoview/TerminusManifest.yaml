  fullDescription: "Photoview is a simple and user-friendly photo gallery that's made\
    \ for photographers and aims to provide an easy and fast way to navigate directories,\
    \ with thousands of high-resolution photos.\n\nYou configure Photoview to look\
    \ for photos and videos within a directory on your file system. The scanner automatically\
    \ picks up your media and start to generate thumbnail images to make browsing\
    \ super fast.\n\nWhen your media has been scanned they show up on the website,\
    \ organised in the same way as on the filesystem\n\n# Main features\n## Closely\
    \ tied to the file system. \nThe website presents the images found on the local\
    \ filesystem of the server, directories are mapped to albums.\n\n## User management.\
    \ \nEach user is created along with a path on the local filesystem, photos within\
    \ that path can be accessed by that user.\n\n## Sharing. \nAlbums, as well as\
    \ individual media, can easily be shared with a public link, the link can optionally\
    \ be password protected.\n\n## Made for photography. \nPhotoview is built with\
    \ photographers in mind, and thus supports RAW file formats, and EXIF parsing.\n\
    \n## Video support. \nMany common video formats are supported. Videos will automatically\
    \ be optimized for web.\n\n## Face recognition. \nFaces will automatically be\
    \ detected in photos, and photos of the same person will be grouped together.\n\
    \n## Performant. \nThumbnails are automatically generated and photos first load\
    \ when they are visible on the screen. In full screen, thumbnails are displayed\
    \ until the high resolution image has been fully loaded.\n\n## Secure. \nAll media\
    \ resources are protected with a cookie-token, all passwords are properly hashed,\
    \ and the API uses a strict CORS policy.\n"
