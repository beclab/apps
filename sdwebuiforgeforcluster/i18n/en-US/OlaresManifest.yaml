    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    Please note that this is a cluster-scoped app, you will need the corresponding client app to use it.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge is a platform on top of Stable Diffusion WebUI (based on Gradio ) to make development easier, optimize resource management, speed up inference, and study experimental features.

    The name "Forge" is inspired from "Minecraft Forge". This project is aimed at becoming SD WebUI's Forge.

    Forge is currently based on SD-WebUI 1.10.1 at this commit. (Because original SD-WebUI is almost static now, Forge will sync with original WebUI every 90 days, or when important fixes.)
