  fullDescription: |
    Penpot is the first open-source design tool for design and code collaboration. Designers can create stunning designs, interactive prototypes, design systems at scale, while developers enjoy ready-to-use code and make their workflow easy and fast. And all of this with no handoff drama.

    # Why Penpot
    Penpot expresses designs as code. Designers can do their best work and see it will be beautifully implemented by developers in a two-way collaboration.

    - Designed for developers
    Penpot was built to serve both designers and developers and create a fluid design-code process. You have the choice to enjoy real-time collaboration or play "solo".

    - Inspect mode
    Work with ready-to-use code and make your workflow easy and fast. The inspect tab gives instant access to SVG, CSS and HTML code.

    - Self host your own instance
    Provide your team or organization with a completely owned collaborative design tool. Use Penpot's cloud service or deploy your own Penpot server.

    - Integrations
    Penpot offers integration into the development toolchain, thanks to its support for webhooks and an API accessible through access tokens.

    # What's great for design
    With Penpot you can design libraries to share and reuse; turn design elements into components and tokens to allow reusability and scalability; and build realistic user flows and interactions
