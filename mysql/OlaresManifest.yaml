  fullDescription: |
    MySQL is an open source RDBMS that uses SQL to create and manage databases. As a relational database, MySQL stores data in tables of rows and columns organized into schemas. A schema defines how data is organized and stored and describes the relationship among various tables. With this format, developers can easily store, retrieve, and analyze many data types, including simple text, numbers, dates, times, and, more recently, JSON and vectors.

    Key Features
    # Easy to Use
    MySQL is considered easy to use among RDBMS. It works with basic SQL and, given its maturity and adoption, there is abundant documentation available.

    # Secure
    MySQL's maturity also lends itself to security. It's regularly updated, has a vibrant developer community, and, because of it's wide adoption within the enterprise, many CVE patches are released before the CVE is announced. These factors combine to make MySQL a stable and secure choice among RDBMS.

    #Open Source
    The community edition of MySQL is enterprise ready, and supported by a GNU General Public License. For users who want access to equitable proprietary functionality of MySQL without the added price tag, there are other options within the ecosystem — like MariaDB — that can add similar levels of functionality and beyond.

    # Scalable
    MySQL is highly scalable for an RDBMS, with a wide range of options not covered in this blog that allow for tuning, customizing and enhancing your MySQL experience. 

    # Reliable
    MySQL is reliable — not just from a data perspective, but from a development perspective. It's mature, it has regular releases, patches, and an entrenched developer community that works with it. This makes it a safe choice compared to newer, less mature RDBMS options.
