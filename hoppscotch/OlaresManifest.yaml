    # Features

    Lightweight:Crafted with minimalistic UI design.

    Fast: Send requests and get responses in real time.

    HTTP Methods: Request methods define the type of action you are requesting to be performed.

    - `GET` - Requests retrieve resource information
    - `POST` - The server creates a new entry in a database
    - `PUT` - Updates an existing resource
    - `PATCH` - Very similar to `PUT` but makes a partial update on a resource
    - `DELETE` - Deletes resource or related component
    - `HEAD` - Retrieve response headers identical to those of a GET request, but without the response body.
    - `CONNECT` - Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource
    - `OPTIONS` - Describe the communication options for the target resource
    - `TRACE` - Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource
    - `<custom>` - Some APIs use custom request methods such as `LIST`. Type in your custom methods.
