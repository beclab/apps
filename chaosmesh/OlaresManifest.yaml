  fullDescription: |
    Chaos Mesh is an open source cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform. It offers various types of fault simulation and has an enormous capability to orchestrate fault scenarios.

    Using Chaos Mesh, you can conveniently simulate various abnormalities that might occur in reality during the development, testing, and production environments and find potential problems in the system. To lower the threshold for a Chaos Engineering project, Chaos Mesh provides you with a visualization operation. You can easily design your Chaos scenarios on the Web UI and monitor the status of Chaos experiments.

    # Core strengths
    As the industry's leading Chaos testing platform, Chaos Mesh has the following core strengths:

    Stable core capabilities: Chaos Mesh originated from the core testing platform of TiDB, and inherited a lot of TiDB's existing test experience from its initial release.
    
    Fully authenticated: Chaos Mesh is used in numerous companies and organizations, such as Tencent and Meituan; It is also used in the testing systems of many well-known distributed systems, such as Apache APISIX and RabbitMQ.
    
    An easy-to-use system: Chaos Mesh makes full use of automation with graphical operations and Kubernetes-based usage.
    
    Cloud Native: Chaos Mesh supports Kubernetes environment with its powerful automation ability.
    
    Various fault simulation scenarios: Chaos Mesh covers most of the scenarios of basic fault simulation in the distributed testing system.
    
    Flexible experiment orchestration capabilities: You can design your own Chaos experiment scenarios on the platform, including multiple mixing experiments and application status checks.
    
    High security: Chaos Mesh is designed with multiple layers of security control and provides high security.
    
    An active community: Chaos Mesh is an incubating project hosted by CNCF. It has a growing number of contributors and adopters all over the world.
    
    Easily scalable: It's easy to add new fault test types and functions to Chaos Mesh.
