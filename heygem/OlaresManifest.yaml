  fullDescription: |
    Duix.Avatar (previously known as Heygem) is a fully offline video synthesis tool designed for Windows systems that can precisely clone your appearance and voice, digitalizing your image. You can create videos by driving virtual avatars through text and voice. No internet connection is required, protecting your privacy while enjoying convenient and efficient digital experiences

    # Core Features
    Precise Appearance and Voice Cloning: Using advanced AI algorithms to capture human facial features with high precision, including facial features, contours, etc., to build realistic virtual models. It can also precisely clone voices, capturing and reproducing subtle characteristics of human voices, supporting various voice parameter settings to create highly similar cloning effects.
    
    Text and Voice-Driven Virtual Avatars: Understanding text content through natural language processing technology, converting text into natural and fluent speech to drive virtual avatars. Voice input can also be used directly, allowing virtual avatars to perform corresponding actions and facial expressions based on the rhythm and intonation of the voice, making the virtual avatar's performance more natural and vivid.
    
    Efficient Video Synthesis: Highly synchronizing digital human video images with sound, achieving natural and smooth lip-syncing, intelligently optimizing audio-video synchronization effects.
    
    Multi-language Support: Scripts support eight languages - English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.
    
    # Key Advantages
    Fully Offline Operation: No internet connection required, effectively protecting user privacy, allowing users to create in a secure, independent environment, avoiding potential data leaks during network transmission.
    
    User-Friendly: Clean and intuitive interface, easy to use even for beginners with no technical background, quickly mastering the software's usage to start their digital human creation journey.
    
    Multiple Model Support: Supports importing multiple models and managing them through one-click startup packages, making it convenient for users to choose suitable models based on different creative needs and application scenarios.
    
    # Technical Support
    Voice Cloning Technology: Using advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to generate similar or identical voices based on given voice samples, covering context, intonation, speed, and other aspects of speech.
    
    Automatic Speech Recognition: Technology that converts human speech vocabulary content into computer-readable input (text format), enabling computers to "understand" human speech.
    
    Computer Vision Technology: Used in video synthesis for visual processing, including facial recognition and lip movement analysis, ensuring virtual avatar lip movements match voice and text content.
