  upgradeDescription: |
    This version resolves a single issue with a database migration.

    ## Important notes on upgrading ##
    This version fixes an issue with an existing migration that prevented upgrades from completing. It does not include any new migrations, and for multi-node deployments, should not require any downtime.

    Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations, and start again, no matter how "big" or "small" the upgrade is. This behavior can be changed by adding a /etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure file, which is only used for updates.
