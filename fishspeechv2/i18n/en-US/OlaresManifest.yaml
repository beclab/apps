    This is a shared app. Only one service will be installed across the entire Olares system. Every user can install a desktop entry to access or use the shared entrance to call the service API.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    True human-like Text-to-Speech and Voice Cloning
    
    FishAudio-S1 is an expressive text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning model developed by Fish Audio, designed to generate speech that sounds natural, realistic, and emotionally rich — not robotic, not flat, and not constrained to studio-style narration.
    
    FishAudio-S1 focuses on how humans actually speak: with emotion, variation, pauses, and intent.

    Features
    - Zero-shot & Few-shot TTS: Input a 10 to 30-second vocal sample to generate high-quality TTS output.

    - Multilingual & Cross-lingual Support: Simply copy and paste multilingual text into the input box—no need to worry about the language. Currently supports English, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, French, German, Arabic, and Spanish.

    - No Phoneme Dependency: The model has strong generalization capabilities and does not rely on phonemes for TTS. It can handle text in any language script.

    - Highly Accurate: Achieves a low CER (Character Error Rate) of around 0.4% and WER (Word Error Rate) of around 0.8% for Seed-TTS Eval.

    - Fast: Accelerated by torch compile, the real-time factor is approximately 1:7 on an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU.

    - WebUI Inference: Features an easy-to-use, Gradio-based web UI compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and other browsers.
    
    - GUI Inference: Offers a PyQt6 graphical interface that works seamlessly with the API server. Supports Linux, Windows, and macOS.
