  fullDescription: 'The most powerful and modular stable diffusion GUI and backend.

    This ui will let you design and execute advanced stable diffusion pipelines using
    a graph/nodes/flowchart based interface.


    Features

    - Nodes/graph/flowchart interface to experiment and create complex Stable Diffusion
    workflows without needing to code anything.

    - Fully supports SD1.x, SD2.x, SDXL, Stable Video Diffusion and Stable Cascade

    - Asynchronous Queue system

    - Many optimizations: Only re-executes the parts of the workflow that changes
    between executions.

    - Command line option: --lowvram to make it work on GPUs with less than 3GB vram
    (enabled automatically on GPUs with low vram)

    - Works even if you don''t have a GPU with: --cpu (slow)

    - Can load ckpt, safetensors and diffusers models/checkpoints. Standalone VAEs
    and CLIP models.

    - Embeddings/Textual inversion

    - Loras (regular, locon and loha)

    - Hypernetworks

    - Loading full workflows (with seeds) from generated PNG files.

    - Saving/Loading workflows as Json files.

    - Nodes interface can be used to create complex workflows like one for Hires fix
    or much more advanced ones.

    - Area Composition

    - Inpainting with both regular and inpainting models.

    - ControlNet and T2I-Adapter

    - Upscale Models (ESRGAN, ESRGAN variants, SwinIR, Swin2SR, etc...)

    - unCLIP Models

    - GLIGEN

    - Model Merging

    - LCM models and Loras

    - SDXL Turbo

    - Latent previews with TAESD

    - Starts up very fast.

    - Works fully offline: will never download anything.

    - Config file to set the search paths for models.
