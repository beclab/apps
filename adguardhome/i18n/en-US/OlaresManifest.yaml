spec:
  fullDescription: |
    AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

    It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers, and both share a lot of code.

    Features:
    Block ads everywhere
    - Block ads at the network level and protect both browsers and apps. Choose from dozens of ad filters to remove ads from websites, video players, and games
    
    Safeguard your privacy
    - Protect your personal and other sensitive information from online trackers and analytics systems that try to steal your data as you browse the Web
    
    Shield your kids
    - Shield your kids from inappropriate online content with the help of Parental Control and enforce Safe Search in their browsers
    
    Protect your entire network
    - Install AdGuard Home on your router and automatically protect all devices on your network, including IoT devices. No individual client apps required
