    # Security
    - Disallow the media proxy from fetching resources on private networks to mitigate potential SSRF issues. This behavior is configurable at the instance level.
    - Disallow fetching feed icons from private networks to reduce the SSRF attack surface. This is also configurable at the instance level.
    - Add the TRUSTED_REVERSE_PROXY_NETWORKS configuration option to prevent spoofing of HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Proto, and X-Real-Ip. This option must be configured when AUTH_PROXY_HEADER is enabled.
    - Stop logging generated Google Reader API tokens, even when debug mode is enabled.
    - Remove the CORS handler from the Google Reader API, as it is not intended to be used by web clients, reducing the overall attack surface.

    # Performance and Storage
    - Avoid indexing the content of removed entries, significantly reducing database index size after cleanup.
    - Minor storage and database refactoring to simplify code paths and reduce unnecessary formatting overhead.

    # API and Integrations
    - Add a new API endpoint to import entries into an existing feed.
    - Execute the content sanitizer when updating or importing entries through the API to ensure consistent sanitization.
    - Improve Google Reader API compatibility by removing unnecessary output parameter checks and aligning behavior with other open-source RSS readers.
    - Add an auto-push option to the Readeck integration.

    # User Interface
    - Add smooth page transitions for a more polished navigation experience.
    - Add a route to view individual starred entries directly from a category’s starred list.
    - Add a link to the GitHub contributors page in templates.
    - Update all translations.

    # Documentation and Tooling
    - Improve consistency and fix typos in the miniflux(1) manual page.
    - Remove the obsolete version key from Docker Compose examples.
    - Update the Go devcontainer image to go:1-trixie.
    - Update the Distroless container base image to Debian 13.
    - Update GitHub Actions dependencies.
