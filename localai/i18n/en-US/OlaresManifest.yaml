  fullDescription: |
    LocalAI is the free, Open Source OpenAI alternative. LocalAI act as a drop-in replacement REST API that's compatible with OpenAI (Elevenlabs, Anthropic... ) API specifications for local AI inferencing. It allows you to run LLMs, generate images, audio (and not only) locally or on-prem with consumer grade hardware, supporting multiple model families. Does not require GPU.

        Features
        - Text generation with GPTs (llama.cpp, transformers, vllm ... and more)
        - Text to Audio
        - Audio to Text (Audio transcription with whisper.cpp)
        - Image generation
        - OpenAI-alike tools API
        - Embeddings generation for vector databases
        - Constrained grammars
        - Download Models directly from Huggingface
        - Vision API
        - Reranker API
        - P2P Inferencing
        - Voice activity detection (Silero-VAD support)
        - Integrated WebUI!

    Welcome to LocalAI 3.7.0

    This release introduces Agentic MCP support with full WebUI integration, a brand-new neutts TTS backend, fuzzy model search, long-form TTS chunking for chatterbox, and a complete WebUI overhaul.
    We’ve also fixed critical bugs, improved stability, and enhanced compatibility with OpenAI’s APIs.

    What’s New in LocalAI 3.7.0
    Agentic MCP Support (WebUI-enabled)	
    - Build AI agents that use real tools (web search, code exec). Fully-OpenAI compatible and integrated into the WebUI.
    
    neutts TTS Backend (Neuphonic-powered)	
    - Generate natural, high-quality speech with low-latency audio — ideal for voice assistants.
    
    WebUI enhancements
    - Faster, cleaner UI with real-time updates and full YAML model control.
    
    Long-Text TTS Chunking (Chatterbox)
    - Generate natural-sounding long-form audio by intelligently splitting text and preserving context.
    
    Advanced Agent Controls
    - Fine-tune agent behavior with new options for retries, reasoning, and re-evaluation.
    
    New Video Creation Endpoint
    - We now support the OpenAI-compatible /v1/videos endpoint for text-to-video generation.
    
    Enhanced Whisper compatibility
    - Whisper.cpp is now supported on various CPU variants (AVX, AVX2, etc.) to prevent illegal instruction crashes.
    
    Fuzzy Gallery Search
    - Find models in the gallery even with typos (e.g., gema finds gemma).
    
    Easier Model & Backend Management
    - Import, edit, and delete models directly via clean YAML in the WebUI.
    
    Realtime Example
    - Check out the new realtime voice assistant example (multilingual).
    
    Security, Stability & API Compliance
    - Fixed critical crashes, deadlocks, session events, OpenAI compliance, and JSON schema panics.
    
    Qwen 3 VL
    - Support for Qwen 3 VL with llama.cpp/gguf models
