    - Easily find specific pictures using powerful search filters
    - Recognizes the faces of your family and friends
    - Automatic classification of pictures based on their content and location
    - Play Live Photos by hovering over them in albums and search results
    - Since the User Interface is a Progressive Web App, it provides a native app-like experience, and you can conveniently install it on the home screen of all major operating systems and mobile devices
    - Includes 4 high-resolution World Maps to bring back the memories of your favorite trips
    - Metadata is extracted and merged from Exif, XMP, and other sources such as Google Photos
    - Many more image properties like Colors, Chroma, and Quality can be searched as well
    - Use PhotoSync to securely backup iOS and Android phones in the background
