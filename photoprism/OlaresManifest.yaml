    PhotoPrism is an AI-Powered Photos App for the Decentralized Web. It makes use of the latest technologies to tag and find pictures automatically without getting in your way. You can run it at home, on a private server, or in the cloud.

    # Feature Overview
    Our mission is to provide the most user- and privacy-friendly solution to keep your pictures organized and accessible. That's why PhotoPrism was built from the ground up to run wherever you need it, without compromising freedom, privacy, or functionality:

    - Browse all your photos and videos without worrying about RAW conversion, duplicates or video formats
    - Easily find specific pictures using powerful search filters
    - Recognizes the faces of your family and friends
    - Automatic classification of pictures based on their content and location
    - Play Live Photos by hovering over them in albums and search results
    - Since the User Interface is a Progressive Web App, it provides a native app-like experience, and you can conveniently install it on the home screen of all major operating systems and mobile devices
    - Includes 4 high-resolution World Maps to bring back the memories of your favorite trips
    - Metadata is extracted and merged from Exif, XMP, and other sources such as Google Photos
    - Many more image properties like Colors, Chroma, and Quality can be searched as well
    - Use PhotoSync to securely backup iOS and Android phones in the background
    - WebDAV clients such as Microsoft's Windows Explorer and Apple's Finder can connect directly to PhotoPrism, allowing you to open, edit, and delete files from your computer as if they were local.

    Upgrade to PhotoPrism 250707-d28b3101e

    This release adds support for using Ollama models in the Vision AI service, improves search performance, and introduces an "Adjust Location" dialog for setting photo coordinates on a map. Users can now delete albums from the toolbar and customize the language of location details. Video and metadata handling have been refined, with updates to transcoding, scanner detection, and CLI tools. A fix for SQLite index updates is also included. Batch editing features are in final development and will be available in an upcoming release. As always, a big thank you to everyone who contributed and helped with testing!
