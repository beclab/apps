    ## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
    This is the corresponding client app of "Faster Whisper For Cluster". It requires "Faster Whisper For Cluster" to be installed on your Terminus cluster first.

    ## OVERVIEW ##
    faster-whisper-server uses faster-whisper as it's backend, and is able to provide OpenAI API compatible transcription server

    faster-whisper is a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model using CTranslate2, which is a fast inference engine for Transformer models.
    This implementation is up to 4 times faster than openai/whisper for the same accuracy while using less memory. The efficiency can be further improved with 8-bit quantization on both CPU and GPU.

    Features:
    GPU and CPU support.
    Configurable through environment variables (see config.py).
    OpenAI API compatible.
